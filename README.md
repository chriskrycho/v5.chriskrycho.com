The fifth iteration of my website! For details, see [the launch post]!

Previous versions:

- [v1.chriskrycho.com][v1]—my Blogger blog as it was from 2006–2011, originally at `blog.chriskrycho.com`, but I decided I wanted that domain available to redirect to whatever is my current *blog* site.
- [v2.chriskrycho.com][v2]—a simple site that I used as a portfolio and for some experimentation in 2011.
- [v3.chriskrycho.com][v3]—a family of [WordPress] sites, where I ran my various blogging from 2012–2013.
- [v4.chriskrycho.com][v4]—a statically-generated site built in [Pelican], from 2014–2018.
