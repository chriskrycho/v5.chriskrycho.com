I’ve been podcasting since 2014 and have spoken at a number of conferences since 2015. (See [below](#past-talks) for some of the talks I’ve given over the years!) I am equally happy having off-the-cuff discussions and giving deeply-prepared presentations.

I enjoy talking about a variety of subjects:

- software development, including (but not limited to):
    - open source software
    - programming languages, especially Rust and TypeScript
    - teams and culture
- technology, tech criticism, and tech ethics
- Christianity
- mental health
- the intersection of any or all of these

If those sound interesting to you, I’d love to be on your show or speak at your conference! I have a top-notch recording setup with excellent audio and video equipment, so I can deliver a high-quality experience remotely as well as in person.

For podcasts or panel discussions, please give me at least of a month of notice so I can coordinate it with my family and fit it into my work schedule. For talks, I need at least two months’ notice so I can deliver a quality presentation and (for in-person events) coordinate travel with my family and work.
