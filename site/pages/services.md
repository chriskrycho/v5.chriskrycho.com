I help teams with front-end web strategy development, TypeScript adoption and conversion, and Rust adoption. I also provide individual coaching.

## For Companies

I provide front-end technical strategy, teaching and workshops for TypeScript and Rust, and technical solutions for TypeScript and Rust code bases.

### Front-end technical strategy

I excel at helping you cut through the noise and find a path forward for your web user interfaces.

- In 2024, I helped [Subsplash][sub] develop a strategy to modernize and integrate their many apps with multiple front-end technologies.
- I officially led front-end web development for LinkedIn’s desktop web app 2021–2023, and developed the technical strategy for the same app 2019–2021.
- In 2018, I created the strategy for Olo’s Serve platform—the strategy that they successfully executed on after my departure.

### TypeScript

- I can teach your team how to use TypeScript effectively, even if you have never written a line of the language before.
- I can help you develop a strategy for successfully adopting TypeScript with the specific details of your own organization and code base.
- I can deliver robust types for the weirdest and thorniest parts of your existing JavaScript codebase.

I spearheaded LinkedIn’s adoption of TypeScript, solved the hardest technical problems for TypeScript adoption at LinkedIn, and started and led the Ember.js TypeScript initiative from 2017–2023.

### Rust

- I can provide workshops to teach your team Rust.
- I can jump into your code base and help you get things done.

From 2015–2019, I ran the premier Rust podcast, [New Rustacean][nr], which taught tens of thousands of people the Rust programming language… on hard mode. (Try teaching a programming language via podcast!) In 2024, I wrote the chapter on async and await for [<cite>The Rust Programming Language</cite>][trpl], the official book on the language (chapter forthcoming). I also helped build, and continue to help maintain, [Volta][volta], a JavaScript toolchain manager written in Rust.

### Coaching and mentoring

In my time at LinkedIn, I mentored over half a dozen engineers, ranging from apprentices just getting their footing to Staff engineers thinking about how to be effective in their role. I can help you, too!
