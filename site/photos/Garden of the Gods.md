If I were to shoot this same photo again, I would drop the shutter speed a bunch so it would be at a lower <span class='smcp'>ISO</span>: It’s not particularly apparent except when pixel peeping, but there is a lot of noise… and this was broad daylight; there was no reason to be at <span class='smcp'>ISO</span> 4,000!
