On Friday, I went down to [Provision Bread & Bakery](https://www.provisionbread.com) in downtown Colorado Springs and got myself a delicious loaf of sourdough, their absurdly delicious croissant cinnamon roll, and this delightful cup of espresso from [Cinchona Coffee](https://cinchonacoffee.com), which is one of the best coffee shops in the city and shares the space.

The green ceramic was particularly lovely in the autumn morning light.
