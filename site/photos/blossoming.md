Two days ago, walking through our neighborhood. And yesterday evening, trying to dial in the colors in Lightroom <abbr title="Creative Cloud">CC</abbr>: more practice on color grading and image processing.

The Œ±7R V‚Äôs out-of-camera colors (like Sony‚Äôs in general) are‚Ä¶¬†*fine*. The strength of the camera is in its technical underpinnings and the fact that I *can* pull out these kinds of lovely images. Over time, I am going to have to build myself some presets that I can use, but first I need to understand the mechanics and build some intuitions.
