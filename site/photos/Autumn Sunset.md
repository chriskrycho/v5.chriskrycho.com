A lovely (subtle) sunset last autumn. I dropped out the shadows here a *lot*: in “real life” and in the photograph both, the foreground was quite visible… neighborhood and mountains alike. But I think about this a lot: the *effect* of this photo is much more like what it *felt* like that evening. The human mind can focus on the sky in a scene like this in person in a way that a photograph which “accurately” represents the scene completely misses.
