My family and I recently went to Disney World as a huge celebration of paying off our house (!) this spring. For the trip I rented the [Sony Œ±7 IV][camera] and the [Tamron 35‚Äì150mm ùëì/2‚Äì2.8 Di III VXD][tamron-lens], and I also took along my recently acquired [Sony Sonnar T\* FE 55mm ùëì/1.8 ZA][sony-lens]. Over the course of the week, I took a bunch of notes on using each.

On the rental: I have, over the past few years, become a repeat customer at LensRentals. They have the best customer service of literally any company I do business with. On the new-to-me 55mm lens: I snagged it at about half price via the [/r/photomarket/][reddit] subreddit. Highly recommend.
