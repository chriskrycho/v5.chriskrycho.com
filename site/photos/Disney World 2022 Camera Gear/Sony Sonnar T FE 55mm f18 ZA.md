  Sony‚Äôs 55mm lens is one of the oldest primes in its full-frame line-up, and it misses a few features from more recent primes‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still an excellent piece of glass.

My family and I recently went to Disney World as a huge celebration of paying off our house (!) this spring. For the trip I rented the [Sony Œ±7 IV][camera] and the [Tamron 35‚Äì150mm ùëì/2‚Äì2.8 Di III VXD][tamron-lens], and I also took along my recently acquired [Sony Sonnar T\* FE 55mm ùëì/1.8 ZA][sony-lens]. Over the course of the week, I took a bunch of notes on using each. *This* post focuses on the Sony lens; see the sibling posts for details on the camera and the Tamron lens!

## First impressions (June 4)

This thing is *small*: smaller than my previous go-to standard lens, the [Sony FE 35mm ùëì/1.8][35mm], and *waaaaay* smaller than the 35mm‚Äì100mm Tamron I am comparing it to most directly. But it‚Äôs also incredibly sharp, fast, and easy to use. The only thing that I find as an immediate downer is the lack of a switch to toggle between manual and auto focus‚Äîsomething which has become standard on Sony‚Äôs lenses since this was released. Toggling between the two requires going through menus *or* wiring up a custom button. (I‚Äôll probably do the latter, since I don‚Äôt have any other custom button mappings I rely on yet.)

That one minor issue notwithstanding, my immediate impression is that this is probably going to become my default lens for most day-to-day things‚Ä¶ which is exactly why I bought it. I have spent the past year or so constantly feeling ‚ÄúThis is slightly too wide‚Äù when using the aforementioned 35mm and ‚ÄúThis is slightly too narrow‚Äù for my *other* favorite prime lens, the [Sony FE 85mm ùëì/1.8 Lens][85mm]. The thing which tipped me over the edge was taking a bunch of pictures at an [Anselm Society][as] pub night late in May, where I debated before leaving which to take, chose the 85mm and found it, once again, just a bit too narrow. As I was picking between the two, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThe 55mm would be perfect for this‚Ä¶‚Äù and the very next day I got on [/r/photomarket][reddit] to buy the lens.

## Travel day (June 5)

As is my habit in airports‚Äîespecially when, as today, we ended up with an hour-long delay to our flight‚ÄîI shot a handful of photos to entertain myself. For the airport time, I stuck with the 55mm lens on the Œ±7 IV body. It continues to impress. I took a handful of photos with it, in the same place I took some of the earliest photos I took with the Œ±7R IV and the 35mm lens which has been my go-to when I rented *that* back in October 2019.

## After a walkabout day

*Written June 10.*

Yesterday, with my back and shoulders feeling a bit tired after days of carrying a *very* heavy bag (and, Wednesday, also carrying a bunch of custom lightsabers!) I decided to walk around with this lens instead of the Tamron I had carried up the earlier days in the week. It is *incredibly* lighter, and I was glad of the choice throughout the day. It reconfirmed to me overall that I really do prefer primes as a default; I would rather walk around with a single really solid lens at a fixed focal length and roll with the challenges that presents that work with a zoom *most of the time*. That said, as I note in the sibling post, I *really* liked walking around with the Tamron and I think I will carry that lens instead of this prime for the rest of the trip.

For portraits, it‚Äôs simply phenomenal. It feels like cheating.

The lens isn‚Äôt without some downsides, though. One I noticed is the fringing which shows up here, particularly on the edges of the shadows and the birds and the edge of the concrete:[^same-bird-photo]

I was able to fix *most* of that with Lightroom, but not all: if you look closely shadow of the bird on the left, you‚Äôll see there is still some green fringing, and likewise some purple fringing on the shadow of the bird on the right:

Net, it seems to me that fringing in particular is a case where you get what you pay for! Of course, you also get what you *weigh* for, as it were: the much better 50mm G Master lens for Sony is *much* larger and heavier at 1.7 pounds vs. this lens‚Äô 0.6 pounds. The Tamron 35‚Äì150mm, for comparison, is 2.6 pounds, so the alternative Sony lens is closer to that huge zoom than to this small prime!

[^same-bird-photo]: This photo ending up being a great demonstration of the tradeoffs of the camera body, as well: thus ending up in both posts!

## Parting thoughts

*Written June 14.* Unlike the Œ±7 IV and the Tamron lens, this 55mm didn‚Äôt go back to LensRentals today‚Äîand I‚Äôm glad! As noted at the top, it filled a key hole in my collection of prime lenses: I now have very good primes at 20mm, 35mm, 55mm, and 85mm. While, as noted in the companion post, I will be saving up for the Tamron, I feel really happy with these as my go-to lenses: they‚Äôre flexible enough to shoot basically any conditions I normally shoot in, and cover the kinds of photographs I generally like to take.

This lens in particular will likely become my go-to for family events: it‚Äôs a better portrait lens than the 35mm, but wide enough to be easier to use in group settings than the 85mm. It‚Äôs also much smaller than especially the 85mm and is therefore somewhat less obtrusive. I will always be The One With A Camera‚Ñ¢, but if that camera‚Äôs lens can be smaller that means it attracts much less attention, and in most of the group settings to which I take a camera, that is only a good thing.

Given all of those, I‚Äôm not at all tempted by Sony‚Äôs *much* larger and heavier 50mm lens. A revision to *this* lens with some of the features which the 35mm and 85mm lenses feature‚Äîespecially the focus lock button and the focus mode switch on the body‚Äîmight get me looking. (I did indeed set up a custom button to switch from manual to auto focus, and that was better than nothing, but I do *very* much prefer the clicky switch on the lens itself!) For now, though, I‚Äôm set and happy with this.
