We were on a family walk, and the girls got ahead of Jaimie and me and stopped and looked at the sky—and as we caught up, one of them said, “I love seeing birds all in a group like that!” It took me a minute to figure out what she was talking about: that thin ‘V’ in the sky above our heads—but I was so glad when I did. (Those clouds, too!)

And so I snapped more than one shot—and, happily, came away with both a good landscape crop and a good portrait crop.
