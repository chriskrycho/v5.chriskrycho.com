I spent the whole of my short (~1-mile) hike working on my photography skills and figuring out a bunch of things (such as: if you want a sense of depth to a shot of a trail, don‚Äôt use a 20mm lens üòÖ). And then, a third of the way back from my turnaround point, I saw this and said: [huh!][huh] And then a second *huh* when I went to review the photo: I caught (in motion!) a fly buzzing past.

[huh]: https://craigmod.com/huh/

In sum: a bunch of my experiments on the rest of the walk paid off in this shot (mid-day sun notwithstanding)!

I am backdating these posts to correspond with the days I shot these photos. Thursday‚Äôs photo-posting time was replaced with my weekly (remote) [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com) session; Friday‚Äôs with packing up to drive home; and Saturday‚Äôs with, well, *getting home*.
