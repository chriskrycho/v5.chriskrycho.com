I walked into [Slow Burn Coffee][sbc] and the loveliness of the space stopped me still. The space is full of light, many colors balanced against each other just so, with an impeccable aesthetic consistency: from [the roaster][roaster] to [the bookshelf][bookshelf] hidden away just behind me in this shot to even [the water closet][water-closet]. This place is *lovely*.
