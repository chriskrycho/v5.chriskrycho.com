I walked into [Slow Burn Coffee][sbc] and the beauty of the space stopped me still. The shop is full of light, many colors balanced against each other just so, with an impeccable aesthetic consistency: from [the roaster][roaster] to [the bookshelf][bookshelf] hidden away just behind me in this shot to even [the water closet][water-closet]. This place is *lovely*.

I ended up swapping from [the original][orig] image I posted here to this one‚Äîafter going back and forth mentally for a long while! Both of them are good, but they have different characters, and I ultimately preferred this one.
