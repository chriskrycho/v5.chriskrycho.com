Just where Albuquere is most clearly working to improve the aesthetics of the Rio Grande running through the city, it is least attractive *now*—but not without interest. This particular spot caught my eye running north, though, so when I came south, I stopped to capture the little hints of blue and green in the drainage. (Note to self for next time: shoot in [Halide](https://halide.cam).)
