What‚Äôs a trip to Albuquerquere in the spring *without* seeing a bunch of hot air balloons, anyway?

I am backdating these posts to correspond with the days I shot these photos. Thursday‚Äôs photo-posting time was replaced with my weekly (remote) [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com) session; Friday‚Äôs with packing up to drive home; and Saturday‚Äôs with, well, *getting home*.

Also, courtesy of a dumb mistake called ‚Äúleaving my extra battery at home‚Äù I ended up shooting the last two days of the week on my iPhone 12. Happily, it‚Äôs a great camera; a couple of the earlier days in the week came from that camera *anyway*.
