What’s a trip to Albuquerquere in the spring *without* seeing a bunch of hot air balloons, anyway?

I am backdating these posts to correspond with the days I shot these photos. Thursday’s photo-posting time was replaced with my weekly (remote) [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com) session; Friday’s with packing up to drive home; and Saturday’s with, well, *getting home*.

Also, courtesy of a dumb mistake called “leaving my extra battery at home” I ended up shooting the last two days of the week on my iPhone 12. Happily, it’s a great camera; a couple of the earlier days in the week came from that camera *anyway*.
