I’m on a week-long solo vacation—and I have challenged myself to take and post share exactly one interesting photo each day, as a way of [focusing my attention][buttondown] via the combination of camera and intent. (Spoilers: it requires *taking* more than one shot each day to be able to *post* one shot each day.)
