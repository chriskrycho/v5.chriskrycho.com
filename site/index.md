Hello!

I'm Chris Krychoâ€”a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad. I'm a [software engineer](/cv/) by trade; a theologian and [composer](https://music.chriskrycho.com) by vocation; and a writer, [runner and cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/chriskrycho), and erstwhile podcaster by hobby.

I help teams with front-end web strategy development, TypeScript adoption and conversion, and Rust adoption. [Hire me to work with you!](/services/)
