Hello!

I’m Chris Krycho—a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad. I build software for a living; I also write about ethics, tech, faith, and art here and [elsewhere]; I [podcast] about the same topics; and I run (regularly) and compose music (less regularly). Please [say hello]!

<div class='note'>

Things are under construction around here! I decided it was better to go ahead and launch than to stay in “but it’s not finished yet!” mode forever. A lot of things will look and work better over the next couple months.
