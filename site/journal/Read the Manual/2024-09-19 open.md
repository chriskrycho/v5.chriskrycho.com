`man open` on macOS is super interesting. I have used `open -a` to launch specific apps for years, but I have never looked at all the *other* options. There are many, and they are pretty cool! Here are just a few of the neat things you can do:

- `open -e` opens the item in TextEdit. I basically never want this, and it’s fascinating that it’s built in.

- `open -t` opens in your default text editor—for me it’s BBEdit; but whatever you have configured will do. Note: this is not `$EDITOR` but LaunchServices: a macOS-ism.

- `open -F` opens a “fresh” version of the app, not doing window or document restoration. Handy if it’s borked!

- `open -R` reveals it in the Finder instead of opening it.

- `open -f` reads input from stdin and opens the results in your text editor (weird but… cool, I think).

There are a bunch of other neat little details like this. I never would have learned them if I had not taken the time to `man open` and learn a bit more about this tool. Now it’s a more useful tool in my toolbelt!

I am going to try to make a habit of doing these `man` page samplers every Thursday. They will be on both social media and on my website. [Follow me][follow] wherever is convenient to see when I post them!
