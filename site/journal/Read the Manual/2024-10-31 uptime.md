This week’s [Read the Manual][rtm] is about: `uptime`, or, the thing I wish I had known about when I dug into `last` a few weeks ago. (You can read that one [here][last].) The `uptime` man page is incredibly short and downright Unix-y! It really does just one thing! 🤯

What it does: “show how long system has been running”.

The entire description fits in a tweet:

> The uptime utility displays the current time, the length of time the system has been up, the number of users, and the load average of the system over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

On my machine just now:

```sh
$ uptime
18:58  up 27 days, 12:15, 3 users, load averages: 5.37 5.59 4.39
```

Time to do an OS update, I guess. 😂

That’s it, that’s the whole thing!
