I also have a few observations on [Dorico] after a day of using it. First: it is in general a real delight. Things are designed *very* thoughtfully, and there are a ton of delightful little touches. The keyboard shortcuts just makes sense.[^shortcuts] More than once, I hit a keystroke expecting it to do a particular things—like doing <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>2</kbd> to switch to Write mode—and it just did exactly what I expected.

[^shortcuts]: Though I realized over the course of the afternoon just how deeply I internalized a few of the [Sibelius] shortcuts: despite not having scored anything with Sibelius in the last 8 years, I kept trying to use its shortcuts for note manipulation!
