:::note

The topic of public and private chat came up in a group of technical leaders I’m a part of, and I wrote up a note on why I don’t believe that private chats and <abbr title="direct messages">DM</abbr>s are unhealthy—to the contrary. The following is an expanded and edited version of those comments.

:::

## Private Chat and Mistrust

It’s common in some circles to treat private rooms or DM-heavy Slack teams as a sign and more importantly a *cause* of dysfunction, particularly in terms of team trust. In particular, folks are sometimes tempted to use the metrics Slack provides to measure the health of their organizations: a high value of the private-to-public messages ratio is seen as a fairly direct measure of mistrust. The corresponding assumption is that it also *causes* teams to silo from each other and mistrust each other in the first place. I disagree firmly with both parts of this, and always have!

First, a heavy use of private rooms and <abbr title="direct messages">DM</abbr>s *might* be a reflection of existing mistrust, but *only* a reflection, not a cause. If you ask around, you’ll find that many organizations with widely varying degrees of siloing, trust, collaboration, etc. have very similar ratios of private and public conversation. (That’s exactly what came out in the conversation that prompted this post, in fact!) If two organizations with polar opposite degrees of trust and collaboration have the same ratio of private-to-public conversation, then siloing and mistrust can’t be caused by private chat. Second, this also means that the ratio of private to public chat isn’t even a reliable signal of whether an organization is healthy or not: it lacks any predictive power!

This is exactly what we should expect based on how people interact with each other in the analog world. We have meeting rooms small and large in offices because having space to talk freely one on one or as a small group helps everyone do better in the public spaces. For one thing, even in the healthiest organization, there are going to be times when you’re frustrated with another person or team. When that happens, the most helpful thing is often to go talk to someone else you trust. That gives you space to blow off steam, to work it through mentally or emotionally so you *can* handle it well publicly.

For another, there are plenty of totally “positive” conversations which benefit from privacy.[^1] Sometimes you need to backchannel someone to help them avoid tripping over a political or personal landmine in a conversation. Sometimes you’re coaching someone through a difficult personal situation, or through their career considerations. Sometimes you’re working on a thorny problem and having more input from people with less context would just be a distraction (even if just by way of having to give people enough context to contribute meaningfully). Sometimes you’re processing with your most trusted colleagues about large changes to a company policy which affect you. Sometimes you’re responding privately to a public question about an HR policy based on your own experience. Sometimes you’re just shooting the breeze with a friend!

The list of things which should *not* be in public rooms in a healthy organization is long! Public rooms are good for public discussions… but we must be able to distinguish which discussions *should* be public! Most of us develop a reasonably good sense for what that looks like in an office, because it maps fairly directly to our existing social norms. Many fewer of us have had time to develop the same sense around chat, though, simply because we have used it far less. But in the same way as meeting rooms in an office, private chats serve a vital function in keeping public chat healthy—independent of the healthy trust level of an organization.

It’s worth remembering that “public” on chat is also very different from “public” in an office. If a group of four or five people are sitting around a table chatting through something in a public area in an office, it’s true that anybody could happen along and join the conversation. But in that scenario you don’t have a permanent log of everything that you said previously for someone to browse through, and you have the ability to modulate the conversation however is appropriate for the newly-joining participants. A public conversation around a table is therefore much more like a chat room with no persistent logging—just the opposite of Slack!

## On Decision-Making

Now, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t dangers around private chat. It simply means that the issues aren’t fundamentally matters of organizational trust, or the goodness or badness of private chat in a general sense. Rather, the issues are around *decision-making*—and, as with the other scenarios discussed above, the dynamics are much the same as with in-office interactions.

For example, people particularly worry about whether the chat history is available to others later for context around decisions: in a private chat, the answer is *no*, whereas in a public chat, the answer is at least in principle *yes*. If you’re reliant on a chat archive to let you know whether the decision was made well, though, you’ve discovered a problem with your decision-making process in general, not with chat specifically!

What matters is not that you have a record of every word spoken in a meeting but that the decision-making process is transparent enough that people can trust it, and open enough that if something got missed it can be flagged and reevaluated. Both of these are easier if you don’t involve chat *at all* in the formal decision-making process: public but in a room you aren’t in or aware of can be nearly as much a problem as private chat. A commitment to keeping good meeting minutes, using a decision-making framework (e.g. [RAPID](https://www.bridgespan.org/bridgespan/Images/articles/rapid/RAPIDDecisionMaking.pdf), [RACI](https://racichart.org/the-raci-model/), etc.), and avoiding chat for important decisions are much more helpful here than policies about private vs. public chat.

Accordingly, I recommend away from making significant decisions over chat at all. A chat log is a *terrible* way to understand a decision, just as a video recording of a talk around a table would be—whether the chat was public or private and whether the conference room door was open or locked. By contrast, meeting minutes for synchronous conversations (whether via video or chat or in person) and comment history for asynchronous decision-making (e.g. via <abbr title="request for comments">RFC</abbr>s) are far more accessible and far more useful.

Another legitimate problem is people abusing private conversation as a way to do an end-around on official channel. This is not specific to chat, either, though: people use private meetings as a way of getting around formal decision-making approaches in the office, too. Again, the key is that the reasons for decisions are clearly articulated and open to feedback from all relevant parties. If a decision suddenly changes and there isn’t a clearly-visible reason why, there is an organizational problem… but one that would have existed 

A final note here: it’s possible to weaponize these dynamics: “Why wasn’t this handled privately?” and “Shouldn’t we be having this conversation in public?” are legitimate questions at times, but I have also seen people use them to manipulate instead. In particular, be wary of individuals who push loudly for decisions to be made in public, but themselves regularly use private channels for decision-making. That move is just abusing the stated norm for their own power and advantage. If you have the institutional clout, confront it directly when you see it happen. If you don’t have the clout to pull that off, try to raise it with someone who does. If it’s a pattern with multiple leaders around you, such that you don’t have anyone to raise it with safely, find another team as quickly as you can.

## Conclusion

The legitimate problems that people worry about with private chat are not specific to chat. Many of the other concerns people have about private chat—especially worries that private chat causes or even is a clear measure of organizational mistrust or dysfunction—are  not only unfounded, but in fact misunderstand the deep human need for a whole range of spaces from totally-private one-on-one conversation to totally-public forums.

The net is that even *very* high private-to-public ratios in Slack teams should be expected as both normal and good. That number doesn’t tell you anything about the health of your organization. If you’re worried about mistrust between teams, dig into why you have that distrust in the first place. Don’t blame it on way folks use chat. More: recognize the inherent value of private and semi-private conversations!
