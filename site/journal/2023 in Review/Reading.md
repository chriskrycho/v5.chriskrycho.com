    I read a lot in 2023—far more than in recent years, and all good or very good books at that!

---

This year I finally read all the books I planned to—and then some! At the end of the year, I finished 31  works of nonfiction and 12  this year. I write “finished”, rather than “read”, in the sake of pedantic accuracy. Most of the books on [this year’s list](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/library/reading-list/#2023) were books I read start to finish this year, but not all. A fair number of those were books I had started before this year—in two cases as far back as 2020!—and only got across the finish line in 2023. I was glad to get them across the finish line, though! For a few weeks in November and December, I was texting one of my friends an updated count every few days of how many books I was “actively” reading still. The fact that my count is now 8 is a triumph: at various points in the year it was close to 20!

The other win, perhaps strangely, is that I committed myself to just tabling books I do not intend to keep reading at this point. Sometimes you get everything you need out of the first three chapters of a book. Sometimes you make it halfway through and realize it just is not for you. Sometimes you realize two chapters into a novel that it is terrible dreck that is not worth your time. In any and every one of those cases, *it is okay to stop reading it*. I have always had a completionist bent to my reading, and while I would very occasionally give up on a book before finishing it, the final months of this year saw me actually commit to a habit of making that call and moving on.

I am even beginning to think about books as starting out neutral and having to *earn* their way to completion. We will see if that mentality sticks, but life is too short to waste it on bad books, or even on books which are good but not particularly profitable at this point in my intellectual and spiritual journeys.

What about the good books, though? Well, I read a lot of those, thankfully! Listed below are the best books in each of the categories I read through. Notably missing is poetry—a gap I hope to address in 2024!
