summary:
    After almost 5 years, I left LinkedIn in early October, and am off on a 3-month sabbatical—before diving into something new in early 2024!

After 4 years and 8 months, I left LinkedIn at the start of October. I am really proud of the things I accomplished over those years. Above all, I am proud to have made a difference for the hundreds of engineers at LinkedIn whose day-to-day work I supported. These have been years of considerable personal-professional growth: not only (nor even primarily) in terms of stepping up from the career ladder, but—most especially—in much more deeply mastering my craft and in understanding organizational dynamics.

What’s next? For starters, I am taking a proper sabbatical through the end of 2023. I am spending these months resting, composing, writing, reading, learning things I have not had a chance to learn on the job, and hanging out with my family. In 2024, I am looking for a role where I can combine my passion for teaching, my technical depth, my ability to lead large groups and long projects, and my passion for programming languages and frameworks.

I have written about this in three posts, each with a distinct audience:

1. [Next: Role?](/journal/next/role/): for those curious about where I am heading next… including folks who might want to hire me.
2. [Now: Sabbatical](/journal/next/sabbatical/): for those interested in how I am spending this sabbatical.
3. [Past: Leaving LinkedIn](/journal/next/leaving-linkedin/): for those interested in my decision to quit my last job.
