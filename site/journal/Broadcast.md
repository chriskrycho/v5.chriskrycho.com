I regularly find myself with the urge to share random details of my life on the internet, with the desire that others would appreciate and interact with them in some way. Weirdly, this is one of the things I miss most about Twitter. For example: some completely banal detail about how I experienced cross-country travel and its effects on my sleep schedule.

Why is this draw so strong?

Some of the desire is mere habituation, I'm sure: I *have* shared those kinds of thoughts publicly for a very long time, via Facebook and Twitter. Having been off those platforms for the last six months doesn't eliminate more than a decade of habit over time.

<!-- TODO: on performativity, desire for connection, etc. -->
