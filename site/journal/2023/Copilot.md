  Generative AI has a lot of hype right now, and GitHub Copilot has been hailed as revolutionary. Is it actually any good? (Betteridge’s Law applies, but the details might still interest you.)

I have spent the afternoon and evening playing with [Copilot][copilot]: using it to provide suggestions as I work on building out a custom <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> on top of [the Rust <abbr title="Markdown AST">MDAST</abbr> implementation][mdast-rs]. I have built out a lot of code quickly, because this is the kind of thing where generative AI (especially in software) excels: lots and lots and lots of boilerplate. This little side project is, in this regard, very different from most of my day-to-day work over the past year and change, which has been exceedingly low on boilerplate and high on figuring out what to write in the first place.

I am honestly fairly iffy on the long-term legal status of Copilot. It is not *at all* clear to me whether it *is* legal to do this kind of thing; it is also entirely unclear to me whether it *should* be. I am, for the purposes of this particular post, not tackling that question. I have some vague hopes of writing one or more out-and-out essays on the subject, but: we will see.

The thing that caught my attention about this work most is: while it *feels* slightly faster, because so much code gets automatically 'filled in' for me, I am not sure it actually is any faster. In fact, I think it might be slower. The code generated by Copilot is often wrong, but always subtly so, which means that when I let it fill in any non-trivial suggestion for me, I spend a considerable amount of time doing 'code review' on the code it emits. For a general discussion of why and how this is hard, see [Hillel Wayne's discussion][hw]. My own takeaway is that not only is the shift in modes from writing to reviewing a difficult one, as Wayne discusses in some detail; it is actually *more taxing* and *slower* than just writing the code for anything more than a line or two long.
