In his excellent [<cite>Practical Typography</cite>](https://practicaltypography.com), Matthew Butterick writes in [the chapter “Grids”](https://practicaltypography.com/grids.html):

> Fans of mathematical ratios in grids (also known as *modular scales*) sometimes compare them to music. For instance, Robert Bringhurst says “a modular scale, like a musical scale, is a prearranged set of harmonious proportions”. (<cite>The Elements of Typographic Style</cite>, p. 166.)
> 
> As a musician, I find this metaphor incomplete. Sure, music is written on a grid of harmony and rhythm. But performers don’t rigidly adhere to these grids. Indeed, music that was locked perfectly to a grid would sound sterile and boring. Just as the performer’s ear is the ultimate judge of the music, the typographer’s eye is the ultimate judge of the page.

I actually agree with much of Butterick’s point here (indeed: if the only thing that comes of my writing this piece is that you go read and learn from [<cite>Practical Typography</cite>](https://practicaltypography.com), I will consider this a win). However, his comment about musical grids gets a couple things quite wrong in my view as a composer of music—and the ways it goes wrong are themselves illuminating:

1. The performer’s ear is *not* the ultimate judge of music—at least, not of all kinds of music. Butterick may be thinking here of styles heavier on improvisation and alteration: styles I like and play a fair bit myself, but not *all* styles. I would find it quite offensive if a performer decided to ignore the melodic and harmonic “grids” I chose. So would most audiences for “classical” music (whenever it was composed), where the composers’ intent is highly prioritized.

2. That being said, the *composer’s* ear is in most cases the ultimate judge. Sometimes the right harmony for a given moment in a piece is *not* the “normal” one for the scale and progression; indeed, sometimes the surprise of doing something a little bit weird is the point. You can only tell that something is a “little bit weird” if there is a coherent baseline to refer to, though!

3. The exceptions to the second point are in the context of other compositional choices, e.g. to use a [tone row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_row), or more generally to stay strictly within a given tonal structure—from constructed tonal systems in modern music[^1] to the strict counterpoint works of historical masters like Palestrina and de Victoria. To reiterate, though, this is still a conscious *choice*.

4. Finally, even in highly-structured composed music, there *is* considerable freedom to the performer (including a conductor): How are tempo and dynamics to be interpreted? Just how much emphasis does a <i>marcato</i> imply? How tightly or loosely should this follow the rhythmic markings here to convey the musical sense of the section?

With those points in mind, I offer an alternative formulation of the same closing paragraph:

As a composer, I think this metaphor is quite apt—as long as we understand its limits. Musicians think hard about scales and harmony. These kinds of “grids” serve as starting points, a framework on which to hang the rest of the musical decisions. In some music, that framework is a starting point from which performers are free to make many modifications. Even in other, more strict kinds of performances, the composer herself may both choose an underlying harmonic and rhythmic structure and then consciously deviate from it to achieve a desired effect—or she may use the constraints of a grid to force her to accomplish musical interest in other ways. Rare—but sometimes quite excellent—is the musical piece which has *no* “grid” and is still musically interesting and beautiful. The exact same dynamic holds for typographical scales: they can be anything useful starting points on which to “riff”. Knowing when and how to deploy them is a matter of taste. Just as the composer’s musical sense is the ultimate judge of the music, the typographer’s eye is the judge of the page.

[^1]:	This has historically been one of my favorite ways to end up in really interesting places tonally for chamber music in particular. My [Single Movement for Clarinet and Cello](https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/single-movement-for-clarinet), for example, works with a constructed “mode” and I had a lot of fun with it.
