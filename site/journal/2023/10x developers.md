title: 10× Developers

I joked [on][li] [social][tw] [media][m] last week:

> Hot take: 10× developers are real. Here’s the secret—

> They’re just developers who actually like what they’re working on.

This joke works because it’s true. It names the phenomenon—well known andn widely appreciated by working developers, at least if the social media response to my joke is anything to go by—of finding yourself working 10× faster on something you love than on something you find merely tolerable, and 10× slower on something you hate than something you find merely tolerable.

I use “10×” here as a stand-in partly because of its role in popular developer culture, but also partly because that rough sense of an order of magnitude of difference in productivity is, in my experience, about right. The joke grew out of very fresh experience. I have been working lately on some things which are deeply unenjoyable, and I am going *slowly* on it. I have thrown every tool in the toolbox at it. Pomodoro. Goal-setting. Withholding the reward of other tasks. Contrasting it with worse tasks. You name it, I have tried it. Those things help, but not as much as one might hope. I am still just… slower. Maybe only 3× slower instead of 10× slower, but slower.

I have, in the past, experienced the exact inverse. Working on a task I loved, I felt myself *flying*. Getting into a [flow state][f] was easy. Staying there easier. Iteration happening as fast as I could think.

This experience sits behind a claim I now regularly see trotted out: that there are no 10× developers, only 10× teams and contexts. This is a false dichotomy! (More on this below.) I agree, though, that thinking about how to make 10× teams and contexts is the right starting point for most engineering organizations. Grant—for the sake of argument—that 10× developers *do* exist. You probably cannot afford to hire them! By contrast, you can work to create and sustain teams where people are predominantly working on things they find highly motivating. Within teams, you can remember that [individuals matter][im] and therefore work hard to keep high [project-person fit][ppf]. Doing that will give you *significant* wins in overall productivity.

There are ebbs and flows to this, of course. Mature engineers understand that sometimes there are unappealing projects, outside their wheelhouses, which just have to get done. This is how I ended up working on my current task. It stinks! It also has to get done.

Now, _contra_ the view currently in vogue among many popular tech Thought Leaders™, I absolutely affirm the reality of 10× developers. I have occasionally gotten to work with them! Talent is real. It does not trump effort, but it does *stack* with effort. This should not surprise us: we know intuitively that some things come easier to some people; that holds across both athletics and academics. Accordingly, people who combine their natural talents with serious hard work can and do produce astonishing levels of work.

Let me be extremely clear here: talent has nothing—absolutely nothing—to do with the moral value of a human being. [Eliud Kipchoge][ek] is a generational talent in endurance running; he works incredibly hard; and he has exactly the same worth as a human being as your or I or anyone else. Just the same goes for any 10× developer you might happen to come across—or any 0.1× developer, for that matter. Human value and worth is not a function of our productivity, but of our [identity][id].
