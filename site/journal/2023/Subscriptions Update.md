I just published an update to [my `subscriptions.opml` file](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/chriskrycho-com/subscriptions.opml): the closest thing I have to a public blog roll. This is a list of every active feed subscription I have in my [Feedbin][feedbin] account. We (still!) don’t really have a good way to share these kinds of lists in a useful programmatic way, and I (still!) kind of want to build one—making it easy to subscribe to feeds listed in other people’s subscriptions in your own reader tool would be great and lower the friction of using feeds! But for now, this kind of occasional update and explicit link to an <abbr title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</abbr> file will have to do.
