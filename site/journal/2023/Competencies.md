At the upper echelons of any sufficiently-large organization, the people present are increasingly there because of a combination of ambition and political savvy, rather than other competencies. However, that also means that selection pressures for *other* competencies are also lower—including, critically, the ones I value much more, like *competence in the domain itself* and *excellence in the craft of software*.

I say:

- “other competencies” because political savvy *is* a competency, and indeed a necessary one in any group larger than a few people.

- “increasingly” because this trend does not eliminate the importance of other competencies; rather, it shifts the balance between political and other competencies.

- “upper echelons” because this is not what we select for *primarily* in “rank-and-file” roles: junior engineers, for example, *do* get evaluated primarily on those first-order competencies and only very secondarily on political savvy.

- “sufficiently-large” because these dynamics do not (typically) emerge in a (healthy) group of five people, but seem always to emerge in (even healthy) groups of more than a few dozen people.
