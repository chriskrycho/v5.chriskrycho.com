At the upper echelons of any sufficiently-large organization, the people present are increasingly there because of a combination of ambition and political savvy, rather than other competencies. However, that also means that selection pressures for *other* competencies are also lower—including, critically, the ones I value much more, like *competence in the domain itself* and *excellence in the craft of software*.

I say “increasingly” and “other competencies” because political savvy *is* a competency, and indeed a necessary one in any group larger than a few people. I say “upper echelons” because this is *not* what we select for in “rank-and-file” roles: junior engineers, for example, *do* get evaluated on those first-order competencies. I say “sufficiently-large” because these dynamics do not (typically) emerge in a (healthy) group of five people, but seem always to emerge in (even healthy) groups of more than a few dozen people.
