  I have a new section on my site, for public drafts: “In Progress”; it currently includes one new essay I am working, which is about just this kind of work in public.

I have just added a new feature to this site: it now includes an *In Progress* section on the home page, which links to posts and essays which I am publishing whiel theya re still drafts. The first of these is [an essay][f] I am slowly building upabout feeds (<abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>, Atom, <abbr title="JavaScript object notation">JSON</abbr> Feed, etc.) and their poor fit for [blog-gardens][g]. It was, in fact, the act of writing this particular essay which prompted me to make this change: it is a way of putting my money where my mouth is.

By definition, these kinds of works-in-progress are *just* works in progress. You should expect them to change, sometimes very substantially, from the time they first appear on the site. They will continue *not* to appear in the feeds for the site (though, as the essay suggests, I have ideas on how to handle that!) until I deem them ready to be “published”—that is, when they are no longer drafts but things I am *committing* to… though not necessarily things I will commit *not to change*!

This also does not, of course, commit me to publishing *all* such drafts this way, nor to publishing any draft at any given stage of publishing. It just gives me a tool for working in public when I think that is the right move!
