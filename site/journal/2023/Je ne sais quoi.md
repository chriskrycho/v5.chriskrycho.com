I have been writing a bunch of Rust again over the past couple days, working slowly to implement pieces of what I *hope* will become the next version of this site.[^v5] Every time I sit down and work with Rust in earnest for any length of time—ten minutes or ten hours spread across a weekend—I have the same feeling I did when I first started messing with it all the way back in the summer of 2015: *This is really good.*

It is not that Rust has no issues. It is not perfect. I have quibbles and complaints. The syntax is not pretty by any stretch. There are rough edges still in both the language itself and the surrounding ecosystem. And yet: it feels *good* in a way I find difficult to put into words. There is just something about building a program in Rust which transcends the individual parts of it (good though those individual parts are), or even the mere composition of those parts (generally very wise-composed though their integration is!). It ends up feeling—somehow—elegant and joyful and satisfying.

<aside>

"Just something about it": We, amusingly and ironically, do not really have the right words for this feeling in English. We end up using the French <i>je ne sais quois</i> because it conveys it better. “Just something about it” gets part of the way there, but lacks, well… that <i>je ne sais quois</i>. We could translate that phrase literally, but I think the language switch *itself* does something to convey the idea: it is not that we actually cannot put the idea itself into words (clearly we can), so much as that leaving the words untranslated actually conveys the *feel* of the idea more accurately

</aside>

Rust is not the only programming language that makes me feel this way. I have much the same experience working in Unison. (Elm, too.) Not so with TypeScript, even if I find it a surpassingly useful and capable tool. Certainly not so with Java nor C♯ nor C++: languages whose contributions I can appreciate but the experience of writing which infuriates me. Not <abbr>PHP</abbr> nor JavaScript nor Ruby nor Python. Not even a language which at first blush *ought* to feel like Rust and Elm, and which I still very much like, such as F♯. Try as I might, I find it impossible to explain exactly what distinguishes the ones I love from those I simply find usable and useful.

This is, in a word, taste.

Taste is famously difficult to pin down, and even more famously not to be accounted for. <!-- TODO: here! -->

[^v5]: It has been about five years since I started working in earnest on the current revision, though working in fits and starts as I did it took me until late 2019 to actually get it to a point I was happy with and launch it. This v6 version is a case where I *hope* to build some technical underpinnings that will last me a decade or more, even if I evolve the design over that time. I expect it to take me another year or two to finish getting it to the point where I can launch it because the underpinnings are—ambitious, to say the least, and the time I have to spend on it is split with other things like family activities, music composition, photography, running, cycling, and so on.
