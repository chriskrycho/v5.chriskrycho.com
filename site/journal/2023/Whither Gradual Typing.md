  audience: >
    Software developers comfortable thinking about type systems—tradeoffs among different kinds of type systems (and thus at least a basic understanding of the existence of different kinds of type systems!), what gradual typing is and how it has been applied to JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Lisp, etc.

Stub, with the following bits for context:

- Jamie Brandon’s most recent log-type post linked to the Elixir papers on gradual typing

- I have been doing TypeScript for 7 years

- Richard Feldman commented in a recent talk (==TODO: find it==) that he does not think

- I tend to agree with Feldman, I think?
