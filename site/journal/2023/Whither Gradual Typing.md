Stub, with the following bits for context:

- Jamie Brandon’s most recent log-type post linked to the Elixir papers on gradual typing

- I have been doing TypeScript for 7 years

- Richard Feldman commented on a recent podcast (==TODO: find it==) that he does not think

- I tend to agree with Feldman, I think?
