  Feature Idea: Week-Level Smart Training Plans
subtitle: >
  Training (at my level, anyway) is less about individual day-to-day work and more about what I do each week. The tools should support that!

  Lots of apps support building (or using) training plans, but they all work on a day-by-day basis, not a week-by-week basis. But that’s not how I work!

Lots of tools have training plans, and some let you build your own… but all of them do the planning on a per-day basis. What I want instead: a plan which tracks workouts by week instead, and marks them completed when you do them any time that week. (I’m currently hacking this with a Numbers spreadsheet. 😭)

Why:  It *does* matter that I do my planned “race pace” hard workout this week. It doesn’t much matter, though, what day it happens. It just needs to be between today and Thursday to allow recovery for a long run on Saturday… and I am sure as heck going to decide which day to do it based on the weather. (Not doing it in the forecasted snow tomorrow!)

Sure, I can update the Garmin Connect Calendar to shuffle things around every day, but… that’s annoying. I want instead to be able to just select a workout from the list I built for the week when I start a run and go. (Or better: *not* have to select it and have the app be smart enough to automatically mark it as completed if you do a run matching its parameters for things like base training runs and rides!)
