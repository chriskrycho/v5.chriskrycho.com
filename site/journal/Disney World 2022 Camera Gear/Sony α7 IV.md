<div class="callout">

My family and I recently went to Disney World as a huge celebration of paying off our house (!) this spring. For the trip I rented the [Sony Œ±7 IV][camera] and the [Tamron 35‚Äì150mm ùëì/2‚Äì2.8 Di III VXD][tamron-lens], and I also took along my recently acquired [Sony Sonnar T\* FE 55mm ùëì/1.8 ZA][sony-lens]. Over the course of the week, I took a bunch of notes on using each. *This* post focuses on the camera; see the sibling posts for details on the lens!

## First impressions (June 4)

The grip is subtly different from the grip on the Œ±7R IV, and *better*. It‚Äôs a tiny bit larger, without feeling large or bulky, in a way that fits my hand much more nicely. If you‚Äôve felt the difference between the Œ±7 III or Œ±7R III and the Œ±7R IV, it‚Äôs the same *kind* of difference.

The button feel is a touch nicer as well in a few cases. As with button feel in general, it‚Äôs a bit hard to describe; it mostly feels slightly more *satisfying* in the case of the shutter button and the wheels on top of the . The Œ±7R IV wheels are slightly *clickier*, but the Œ±7 IV‚Äôs slight decrease in clickiness does not make it feel less sure or reliable, just slightly smoother. Most of the buttons feel otherwise unchanged, with the same small degree of wiggle within the casing but no issue pressing them confidently.

The menu revision is very, very good. I very much wish Sony would roll out this firmware revision to *all* their cameras in recent years. Sony has long been justly criticized for how badly organized and difficult to use its menus are; this should put those complaints more or less entirely to rest. If you haven‚Äôt seen [PetaPixel‚Äôs coverage][ppc] from the new system‚Äôs debut with the Œ±7S III covers it nicely.

The new system immediately felt *familiar* from my use of the Œ±7R IV and [Œ±7C][Œ±7C]‚Äîbut *better*. The overall information architecture is not substantially changed‚Äîbut a few key tweaks improve it substantially. As a key example, I have found it incredibly difficult to tweak the output settings for <abbr title="universal serial bus">USB</abbr> or <abbr title="High-Definition Multimedia Interface">HDMI</abbr> on my Œ±7R IV.

One other detail which caught my attention: the shutter *sound* is subtly nicer than on the Œ±7R IV‚Äîwhich was itself subtly nicer than on the earlier Œ±7 models I have listened to. It‚Äôs a small thing, but one I appreciate!

## Travel day (June 5)

I had the body out a handful of times today, mostly at the airport before we left. Besides the handful of portraits I took with it (on which see my discussion in [the companion post][sony-55mm-post]), I caught this shot of my girls entertaining themselves while waiting for our much-delayed flight:

</figure>

The handling is easy, the menus continue to be *much* nicer to work with, and the pleasant details I noticed the first day continue to strike me

One upside I hadn‚Äôt considered compared to the Œ±7R IV: the much smaller megapixel count means I can take ~2¬Ω√ó as much photo or video on any given <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card. The 64<abbr title="gigabyte">GB</abbr> <abbr>SD</abbr> cards I have will hold over 1,300 photos from this body, vs. fewer than 500 for the Œ±7R IV. That is a *huge* difference.

## Walkabout days

*Written June 10.*

My conclusion at this point is that while I really like a bunch of the improvements in this body, and would probably seriously consider it if my existing camera were an Œ±7 III or Œ±7R III‚Ä¶ I am absolutely going to be sticking with my Œ±7R IV. I can imagine a future Œ±7 VI or Œ±7R VI tempting me away (in half a decade or more!) but as things stand, the Œ±7R IV remains a better fit for me overall‚Äîfor one key reason.

Tight crops are just *much* less usable on the Œ±7 IV compared to the the Œ±7R IV. This is the flip side of the ability to take 2¬Ω√ó as many pictures on the same <abbr>SD</abbr> card: a lower megapixel count has real photographic impact; no few of those those pictures will simply be less useful to me.

Given my love of prime lenses, I have come to rely on the ability to use those <abbr title="megapixel">MP</abbr>s to compensate for lack of reach by way of cropping. Shooting yesterday with the 55mm lens, for example, I took a shot the same way I would have with my Œ±7R IV, and the Œ±7 IV produced something *kind of* usable‚Ä¶ but nothing like what I‚Äôm used to when trying to crop in on these birds:

The Œ±7R IV would have given me a perfectly usable tight crop here‚ÄîI know because I‚Äôve done it, and repeatedly, in worse conditions!‚Äîand that‚Äôs a very, very big deal to me.

## Parting thoughts

*Written June 14.* The camera went back to LensRentals today, and while I quite enjoyed the experience, I stand by my conclusion from a few days ago: I won‚Äôt be buying this one. The one thing about it that *did* tempt me from the past couple days of walking around with it was its bird autofocus feature‚Äîsomething the Œ±7R IV lacks, though most (or perhaps all) of the Œ±-series cameras Sony has introduces *since* then have had it. Besides the excellent pictures I got with the Tamron lens (see *that* post‚Äôs [Closing Thoughts][tamron-lens-closing] section), a walk across a bridge brought us to see this beautiful green heron washing itself and generally chilling out on the water:

</figure>

The bird tracking made grabbing a bunch of shots like this incredibly easy. The same goes for this shot from a few days earlier, with this bird just hanging out with a crowd at Epcot:

</figure>

I don‚Äôt do a *lot* of bird photography, but when I do I will miss this feature! It was really nice, and the lack of it will be one of only two things that feels like a *downgrade* going back to my Œ±7R IV‚Äîthe other, of course, being the menu system. I tweaked my Œ±7R IV‚Äôs settings for the way I use it as a ‚Äúwebcam‚Äù at my desk for video conferencing today, and just let out a sigh at how bad it is.

Net: I‚Äôm really glad I rented the Œ±7 IV and I can highly recommend it: if you‚Äôre able to put out the not-small amount of money the body costs, it is *great*. If I were buying today, and didn‚Äôt already have the Œ±7R IV and therefore have built-up habits around using its massive <abbr>MP</abbr> count for cropping, I would certainly get the Œ±7 IV instead.
