  This zoom lens is versatile and interesting and almost too heavy to carry around… but only almost. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Also yes.

<div class="callout">

My family and I recently went to Disney World as a huge celebration of paying off our house (!) this spring. For the trip I rented the [Sony α7 IV][camera] and the [Tamron 35–150mm 𝑓/2–2.8 Di III VXD][tamron-lens], and I also took along my recently acquired [Sony Sonnar T\* FE 55mm 𝑓/1.8 ZA][sony-lens]. Over the course of the week, I took a bunch of notes on using each. *This* post focuses on the Tamron lens; see the sibling posts for details on the camera and the Sony lens!

## First impressions

*Written June 4.*

The very first thing I noticed about this lens—the very first thing anyone would notice, I expect—is that it is *heavy*. At just over 41 ounces (over 2½ pounds), it’s more than 4× the weight of my most-commonly used lens, the [Sony FE 35mm 𝑓/1.8][35mm]. Considering it before the lens arrived, I wondered if hauling it around Disney World was going to be a good idea, and that concern only doubled when I pulled the lens out of the shipping kit.

Even visually, the thing is almost comically large.

</figure>

Even mounted to the α7 IV, it dwarfs the not-small body:

</figure>

It’s not as large as [the 100–400mm lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1333230-REG/sony_sel100400gm_fe_100_400mm_f_4_5_5_6_gm.html?sts=pi&pim=Y) I rented last year, of course… but it’s not *that* much smaller. For context: the 100–400mm weighs 8 ounces more and is about 2 inches longer—20% bigger across the board. Mind, I’m not complaining: the 35–150mm has a *way* better minimum aperture, and at the size of a telephoto zoom it would be completely unworkable as a carry-around lens. Writing this paragraph now, *before* walking around at Disney World with it, though… I kind of doubt it’s all *that* workable as a carry-around lens.

Its versatility is undeniable, though. As every review I have seen comments, it just works well—incredibly well—at the entirety of its range. It’s a very solid portrait lens:

But it is equally good for shooting a still life at ~55mm:

## Travel day

*Written June 5.*

I barely used this lens today. To be fair, I didn’t much use the camera or the *other* lens, either, but for this monster of a lens in particular, there was just no way I was going to have it out in the few moments I *did* have my camera out in the airport. I finally pulled it out to shoot a few things around our lodge at Disney World, after spending much of the day with the 55mm. The only shot I kept of those I took with it was this landscape:

</figure>

It is nothing remarkable here, though a pretty enough scene. To its credit, though, the lens pulls this off nearly as well as my go-to 35mm prime would have done under the same circumstances.


## Reflections on some walkabout days

*Written June 10:* Monday through Wednesday of this week, I carried this lens with me more or less all day—the only exception being the time we spent at the pool on Wednesday. Yesterday, I switched over to the 55mm lens I brought along, because I wanted *less weight, period*. That gets at the fundamental tradeoff of the Tamron 35–150mm: its size. However, I come here not to bury the lens for its weight but in fact to praise it.

*Written June 12:* To praise it, I affirm these days later, because despite its size it is just—just!—light enough to carry around all day without a sore shoulder. Would I take it backpacking? Well, I don’t go backpacking, but even so: probably not. It’s a lot of weight. But for a day wandering around an amusement park, with it in and out of a decent shoulder bag? Totally doable. The fact that you can get *this much* versatility out of a lens this size persuaded me that I want to buy it… right after I sell my 24–70mm.

## Parting thoughts

*Written June 14.* The lens went back to LensRentals today, and I have zero doubt I will indeed buy it at some point in the future. After I wrote that last note on the 12th, I spent one more day with it: our visit to Disney World’s Animal Kingdom park. And boy was I glad I did. One of the shows we attended was “Feathered Friends,” which has a bunch of very neat tricks performed by birds and their human handlers. Courtesy of having the 35–150mm with me, I was able to take pictures like this:

And, for that matter, these from other times in the week:

Had I had only my 55mm prime lens with me, I could have gotten maybe *one* shot comparable to any of those![^mp] I have a half dozen others from the rest of the day as well: the park is *teeming* with cool birds. The zoom came to my rescue again and again to get an up-close view I could not have gotten otherwise.

In sum, this lens does everything I want and more. I concluded in the companion post about the 55mm lens that it’s likely to become my go-to for events with family and friends… but in a case where I want the *most* flexibility, this lens might take that slot instead. Certainly for travel, I would be inclined to take this and *only* this lens—unless perhaps also the 20mm for landscape shots—because it covers the full range of the rest of my primes, and if it doesn’t quite match any of them for speed (they’re *all* 𝑓/1.8 lenses) its versatility makes up for it in circumstances like that. It may take me a while to get around to buying it, though: at ~$1,800 it’s anything but cheap!

[^mp]: Had I had my own α7R IV camera body instead of the α7 IV, maybe I could have gotten more mileage out of crops, too, but… I didn’t!
