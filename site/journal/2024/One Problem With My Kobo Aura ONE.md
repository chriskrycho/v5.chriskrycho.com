I really only have one problem with my [Kobo Aura ONE][aura]. It is fully seven years old[^1] and works extremely well—in fact works better now than when I got it, other than the very slight (honestly, unnoticeable) decrease in battery life. In fact, it has exactly zero problems. That’s the problem.

You see, I would really like a [Kobo Sage][sage]. The physical page-turn buttons seem attractive, and since we bought our daughters each a [Kobo Clara 2E][clara] for their Christmas present this year I can see that the screen technology has gotten a bit better over the years. A faster and more responsive screen would be nice. I might even take advantage of the stylus integration. All in all, it looks like a great product and a really solid upgrade.

But I have a device I bought seven years ago which is going strong, has no issues, and continues to be one of my favorite pieces of technology to use day to day. I really cannot justify buying something new when there is absolutely nothing wrong and indeed many things very right with the tool I am currently using.

Drat—consumerism foiled by a company doing really good work!

I know where I will shop when, eventually, something goes wrong with the Aura ONE, though.
