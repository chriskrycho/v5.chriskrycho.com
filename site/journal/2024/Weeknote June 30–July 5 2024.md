    Top-level forms in my programming language, half of a major revision pass on the async chapter for TRPL, a first dry run for StaffPlus, and job hunting!

---

The structure and content of this week was much informed by Independence Day! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸŽ†ðŸ¦…ðŸŽ‡

## Software development

I got all top-level declaration forms (structs, enums, and functions, including methods) for my little learning-things-by-doing programming language. No imports yet, and no expressions yet (!), so itâ€™s still very far from, you know, doing things, but: I feel pretty good about having made this progress, given I only decided to do this thing at all a month ago.

## Music

Nothing to report! Just a breather week, after hitting my annual goal for music last week. I expect to div back in next week!

## Writing

- I did the first half of a revision pass on the new async/await chapter forÂ *The Rust Programming Language*. Managed to cut 6 of the 51 (!) code listings I started with by collapsing them together or eliminating where extraneous, and managed to chop almost 900 words out of the almost 15,000 I started with. Good progress!

- I got final revisions in for a book review which should be out (and therefore linked, of course!) next week.

- Two short blog posts here:
	- [Red Pen](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/red-pen/), reflecting briefly on how and why I do revisions of big writing projects the old-fashioned way, by printing it out and taking a red pen to it.
	- [An Observation on Constructor Syntax](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/observation-on-constructor-syntax/), a case of taking something I thought about sending as a <abbr title="direct message">DM</abbr> to a friend, turning it into a blog post, and sending the blog post to the friend and everyone else.

## Speaking

I did the first dry run (just of a rough draft) of the talk I am giving at StaffPlus NY in September. I have aÂ *lot*Â of revising to do, but I have some time!

## Reading

Mostly just a bunch of essays this week, and none so compelling that I feel like sharing them!

## Career/etc.

Steady on with the networking/job hunting for [my next role](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/next/role/)! 

- I wrote an apparently-compelling cold email that turned into a call next week with a developer/engineering-focused startup whose work I really like, so weâ€™ll see where that goes.

- I also had a second conversation with folks I was talking to already, and am mulling hard on that one. An interesting case of them making a bunch of decisions I agree withâ€¦Â leading to shifts in when a role I was super excited about may or may not be available!
