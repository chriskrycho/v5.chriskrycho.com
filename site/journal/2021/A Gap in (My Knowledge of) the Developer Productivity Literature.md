  A Gap in (My Knowledge of) the Developer Productivity Literature

  Where is the equivalent of <cite>Accelerate</cite> for anything outside of DevOps?

summary: >
  The gold standard on developer productivity and engineering effectiveness is Accelerate—but it really only covers DevOps. We need books on all the *other* parts of engineering effectiveness and developer productivity, too!
qualifiers:
  audience: >
    People interested in software engineering effectiveness, developer productivity, and the like.
  epistemic: >
    Exploratory, open-ended, all questions and no answers.

  A conversation with [Will Larson](https://lethain.com) and [Gergely Orosz](http://PragmaticEngineer.com) on the [TechWriters Discord](https://techwriters.dev) catalyzed a bunch of thoughts I’ve had bouncing around in my head from conversations with my manager [Adam Hobson](https://adamhobson.com).

The gold standard for discussing developer productivity and engineering effectiveness is [<cite>Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</cite>](https://bookshop.org/books/accelerate-the-science-of-lean-software-and-devops-building-and-scaling-high-performing-technology-organizations-9781942788331/9781942788331), by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim. As far as I can tell, though, there isn’t even a silver or bronze standard for thinking about developer effectiveness *beyond* the criteria <cite>Accelerate</cite> explores. If you want to think about how to get an organization running in a DevOps mindset, you have a charter! If you want to think about when and how to invest in language adoption, or building editor tooling, or any number of things that are critical to the effectiveness of your engineering team but aren’t really connected at all to DevOps… good luck, you’re on your own.

That’s not in the least a dig at Forsgren, Humble, and Kim: <cite>Accelerate</cite> was groundbreaking, and it covered the territory it set out to cover admirably, by all accounts. It’s just that we need another book—or, more likely, *several* more books!—to cover territory they didn’t: there’s a lot of unmapped terrain out there when it comes to “engineering effectiveness” or “developer productivity.” The work to be done here is in some ways even murkier that the DevOps work was, too. We have decades of academic research on questions like “How do type systems impact developer productivity?” and those efforts have resulted in *small* amounts of progress, but not nearly as much as we might have hoped!

If you know of anything particularly helpful in this area—including academic papers, blog posts, conference talks, etc.—please send it my way. Even more: if you’re an academic who is interested in things like the impact of programming languages, tooling, and <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> design, I’d be particularly curious to talk to you! I am actively thinking about this space and will be sharing whatever I come across here, in the hopes that it will be helpful to others in engineering leadership. And of course, I will share thoughts of my own as I flesh them out as well!
