> The scale question is *super interesting*. For example, I’ve worked on products in the past that ended up in the hands of 100+ million users. That was fun, challenging, frustrating, and exciting, but what I realized was *that scale does nothing for me*. Which was a great thing to realize!

> Realizing that enabled me to refocus my life and work on a scale that excited me. Namely, my current scale, which has a direct reach of some 30,000 (?) people and a secondary reach of a few hundred thousand. These numbers feel like they straddles a healthy line of creative freedom and reach. *Great.*

As your work becomes more popular, people who want to collect it can buy the media — first from you, then from each other. Each time the work is resold, you get a share of the sale price.

There is a sense of going, at last, with the grain of the internet; letting the bits flow freely, copied and recopied, while their coat check ticket, their daemon, that tight little cryptographic knot, sits serene, accruing value. Maybe.

> An observation: bl—ch—[^2] is the complement of social media (and indeed of most internet phenomena); that is: where most internet creations lean into the *lack* of scarcity, with only attention being scarce (HT Ben Thompson of course), bl—ch— has used digital tools to create *artificial* scarcity and (thereby?) “value”. Scare-quoted because, well, those energy considerations and the fact that, as Matt Levine has put it, cryptocurrency is a group of people throwing off the shackles of the last century of modern finance and therefore inevitably recapitulating it by discovering all the reasons things are as they are, usually in the most humorous way imaginable (“we lost the keys to a few hundred million dollars, whoops”).

All of these notes have something in common: all of them are about [scarcity], [edges], [limitations].

[scarcity]: https://stratechery.com/2015/the-funnel-framework/
[edges]: https://craigmod.com/essays/unbinding/
[limitations]: https://thefrailestthing.com/2015/07/09/humanistic-technology-criticism/

The fundamental truth of the internet is that it *scales*: that the marginal cost of digital artifacts is zero. When (re)production is effectively infinitely cheap, considerations that animated scarcity-driven economies fall away. But this does not mean that the economics of scarcity stop mattering: it means instead that scarcity itself becomes scarce, and those who can identify a scarcity and act on that knowledge capture the benefits. Thus: Facebook, Netflix, TikTok, Snap, etc. all correctly identified *attention* as a scarce “resource” to be captured, and have more or less successfully monetized it accordingly.

<aside>

Whether this is a healthy way to think about attention or not, and whether the economy produced by treating attention as a commodity, are not the subject of this post… but my own views are [well established][breakup]. I will, once more, commend Alan Jacobs’ [ Attending to Technology: Theses for Disputation][jacobs].

But the attention economy is not the only scarcity-driven digital economy: another (*the* other?) is “crypto”. The world of Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin (!) and, yes, Zora is premised on *artificial* scarcity: an almost-inevitable, certainly-predictable response to the lack of scarcity of digital goods. The two things which make cryptothings valuable are belief and scarcity: the same as the two things which make any physical good valuable. Unfortunately, cryptothings currently achieve their scarcity by way of [horrific costs][costs] in energy consumption. They are, also unfortunately, nearly always coupled to a naïveté about modern financial regulations that would be hilarious if it weren’t so often catastrophic.[^3]

[costs]: https://carbon.fyi/

“Unfortunately” I say of both of these because the key idea, of artificial scarcity, is a *good* one. Human beings are not meant, at least at present, for infinite scale. (What we will be in the future [“has not yet been revealed.”][1jn] But I rather suspect it will not be infinitude.) When cryptothings create artificial scarcity, it is a reflection of the fact that we have not yet developed a capacity for thinking of value in an abundance economy, and so require the stopgap of hyper-costly artificial scarcity. But given that the scarcity *is* artificial, one cannot help but wonder what might happen if we just skipped the “generate massive pollution” phase.

[1jn]: http://bib.ly/1Jo3.2-3

There are, after all, *other* means of generating scarcity! When Craig Mod thinks about capping his membership program, he is leaning into the fact that one person can only do so much, and that at some point scale becomes inhumane. But he is also creating artificial scarcity, and without the costs associated with cryptothings.

The set of related points on which I’m mulling, then:

- We have not yet designed an economy—financial or otherwise!—which accounts for abundance.
- There are alternative modes of scarcity than those we have so far monetized.
- Which is good, because the current monetizations of scarcity are, in their various ways, all some kind or another of awful.
- But “scarcity” is pointing at something intrinsic to the human and to our place in the world rightly conceived: our (lack of) scale.

This all leaves me wondering: what might happen if we tried Zora… but without the “mining”? And from this wondering emerges a dream of a research program for technologists: What would the implementation of such technologies look like? What would their edges and limitations be? What would they afford, and what would they *not* afford? How might they be well-adapted to us and our scale? How might they be built for mutual thriving with the rest of the creatures with which we share God’s green earth?

Note well the implicit plurality: no room here for single-purpose, all-consuming, hyper-generality! Note, too, that these are not hypotheticals. *We could choose to build these things.* And so we should.

    —because he’s not wrong! (Though of course the nerd in me must note that saying Sauron’s name never had any power to draw his attention: it’s Voldemort he’s thinking of.)
