A friend recently messaged me:

> Hi Chris! Your photos are amazing. Please tell me how you do it. Your cameras. Your lens. Your editing software. Your blogs.

Myself, I know just how many photos I *delete* and how many more even of those I keep I *don‚Äôt share*, but I don‚Äôt mind sharing what I am using and the relatively little expertise I have in the space!

<div class=callout>

Before diving into the answers I wrote up, the big and all-important qualifier: *gear and workflows do not good photography make*. There are photographers out there who can pull of shots with an iPhone 12 camera that I cannot pull off with gear that costs many times as much. Gear is fun, and it definitely *helps*. But good photography is far more the product of a good *photographer*, and becoming a good photographer is all about practice.

</div>

**My blog** is a [super-technical terrible-for-anyone-but-me setup](https://github.com/chriskrycho/v5.chriskrycho.com/) that no one but me (and maybe not even me[^lightning]) should use. There are great setups on WordPress, Ghost, and SquareSpace for that are *way* better. Also: Adobe provides hosted portfolio sites if you subscribe to any photo-oriented tier of Creative Cloud. [Here](https://photos.tdhopper.com) is my friend Tim‚Äôs portfolio hosted that way, for example.

[^lightning]: 11ty is still *fine*, and it‚Äôll probably never make sense for me to finish [my own static site generator](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs), even as a [home-cooked-meal-style app](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/), but *wow* do I ever want to.

Which leads me to **editing software:** I‚Äôm just using Lightroom CC‚ÄîI spend the $10/month on it because it‚Äôs *very* good and very easy to use, including on iPad, which is where I actually do most of my editing. iPad Pro + Apple Pencil is a phenomenal editing experience. I *occasionally* do editing on my computer but‚Ä¶¬†mostly just on my iPad. (Note that to make that work you need one with a lot of storage: I have the 512GB model and that does just fine.)

**Camera:** my normal camera is the [Sony Œ±7R IV](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/all-interchangeable-lens-cameras/p/ilce7rm4-b). It is a *phenomenal* camera body with two features that are both upsides and downsides:

- It is *large*: which makes it a great fit for my (fairly large) hands, and well-balanced with big lenses, but also makes it heavy and bulky.

- It has an *incredibly* high-megapixel sensor: which means I can often get a usable photo even after cropping out , but (a) takes up a ridiculous amount of storage space per-picture‚Äîshooting RAW I end up taking about 1GB of storage from 10 pictures ü§Ø and (b) means it can end up having more noise in low-light conditions.

That is *not* the camera that [prompted this writeup, the person in question having seen me with said different camera]. For our little family trip to Dinosaur National Monument this weekend, I am renting the Sony [Œ±7C](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7c/specifications) as well as a telephoto lens.[^vacation] It is a really nice little camera, which is very, very *different* from the Œ±7R IV. It weighs about as much with the (not tiny!) lens I was shooting with in that goofy picture as the Œ±7R IV does with no lens attached. üòÖ It‚Äôs way friendlier for smaller hands than mine. It also has a much lower-resolution sensor, which means it isn‚Äôt quite as amazing for cropping as mine is, but it performs way better in low light.

[^vacation]: Expect to see a bunch of photos from this trip in the next week, and perhaps even the first one today or tomorrow, along with some thoughts on the Œ±7C.

(That said, if I were recommending a camera in that range, I would recommend the [Œ±7 III][a7III] ‚Äì *not* the Œ±7R III ‚Äì which is basically the same as the Œ±7C, but in a somewhat larger body, but not as large the Œ±7R IV. [Or, possibly, if you can hold out that long, wait for the Œ±7 IV, most recently rumored to be coming in September‚Äî*ed.*])

[a7III]: https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/full-frame/p/ilce7m3-b

**Lenses!** I have lots. My most-used lens is the [Sony FE 35mm ùëì/1.8][35-f1.8], which is the lens I took that picture with. It is a phenomenal all-around lens, and if I had to get rid of *all* my lenses but one, that‚Äôs the one I would keep.

[35-f1.8]: https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/all-e-mount/p/sel35f18f

I also have three others:

- [Sony FE 85mm ùëì/1.8](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/full-frame-e-mount/p/sel85f18-2): an incredible portrait lens‚Äîa bunch of the portrait-style pictures Jaimie sent along came from that.
- [Sony FE 20mm ùëì/1.8 G](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/all-e-mount/p/sel20f18g): a really, really amazing lens for landscape shots
- [Sony FE 24‚Äì70mm ùëì/2.8 GM](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/all-e-mount/p/sel2470gm): a really good zoom lens which can do everything from landscape to portrait quite well‚Äîbut it‚Äôs large and heavy; if I were buying again I might get the [Tamron 28‚Äì75mm ùëì/2.8](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1393332-REG/tamron_a036_28_75mm_f_2_8_di_iii.html) lens instead

For our trip, I‚Äôm renting Sony‚Äôs [FE 100‚Äì400mm ùëì/4.5‚Äì5.6 GM](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/full-frame-e-mount/p/sel100400gm) lens plus the [Sony FE 1.4√ó Teleconverter](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/all-e-mount/p/sel14tc) which makes it effectively a 140‚Äì560mm, and I think I may end up buying that combo later this year because it‚Äôs so useful.

The last thing I‚Äôll say [*ed*: in my note to my friend; see below for more in this post!] is that renting lenses and cameras is a *really* great way of figuring out what you like/want/etc. I have been using [LensRentals](https://share.lensrentals.com/x/P0ryBz) for a couple years now and their rental (and purchase\![^purchase]) prices are really reasonable, and their customer service is <span class=smcp>PHENOMENAL</span>.[^ac] That link = $25 off (for both of us!) if you try them.

[^purchase]: That‚Äôs where I got the 24‚Äì70mm I use.

[^ac]: I don‚Äôt normally do all caps but they deserve it.

Two additional things my friend didn‚Äôt ask about but I‚Äôll cover anyway:

For a **camera bag**, I use the [Everyday Messenger](https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-messenger-v1) by [Peak Design](https://www.peakdesign.com)‚Äîthe original, not their [v2 revision](https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-messenger?variant=29741439189036), which is still good but doesn‚Äôt come in the 15L size. That matters to me not just for camera gear but because I also use it as my bag for laptops, notebooks and pens, etc. on a day-to-day basis, and I need the extra size for my work-supplied 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro. Also, to be perfectly honest, I just don‚Äôt like the design of the new one quite as well! You can‚Äôt get the original new from Peak Design, but you can still find it a few other places online.

For a **tripod**, I use the [Peak Design Travel Tripod](https://www.peakdesign.com/pages/travel-tripod), specifically the carbon fiber variant. It is delightfully small and light‚ÄîI carried it around for hours today (along with a *lot* of other stuff) and it was totally fine. It‚Äôs the only tripod I have contemporary experience with (and the only other tripod I had *any* experience with was a $20 piece of cheap and heavy nonsense from a decade ago), so I can‚Äôt compare it to anything else‚Ä¶ but so far I also haven‚Äôt had *cause* to, because it‚Äôs fantastic.

---

Now, you might wonder whether this is what I would *recommend*. The answer there is a bit more complicated. On the one hand, I definitely don‚Äôt *not* recommend the gear I‚Äôve chosen. I‚Äôm quite happy with all of it. On the other hand, it is a very pricey setup, which I have been able to afford through a combination of saving well and being paid a Silicon Valley salary. And as I noted at the outset: gear won‚Äôt make your photography great. For a good starting-out setup, I would recommend the [Sony Œ±7 III][a7III] for the body‚Äîwhich has frequently been described as one of the best value for money camera bodies ever made, and which you can often find for a few hundred dollars less than its list price; and the [Sony FE 35mm ùëì/1.8][35-f1.8] lens‚Äîwhich as noted above a *great* all-around lens which I‚Äôve used happily for everything from portraits to landscapes.
