In May 2020, I took a week off of work and composed a fanfare celebrating the then-upcoming launch of [SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Demo-2 flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2): the first launch of American astronauts in an American rocket from American soil since the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011. Over the course of the rest of 2020 and the first half of 2021, I iterated on the score for and a recording of the fanfare.
