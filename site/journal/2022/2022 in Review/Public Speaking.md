Public speaking of all sorts remains an important part of the work I want to do—writing and speaking are complementary, rather than replacements for each other—and 2022 was a decent year for speaking for me.

<aside>

I could put this in my forthcoming Professional post, but I figured it made sense by itself, especially since not *all* my speaking is directly connected to work.

</aside>

I set out with a goal of giving two conference talks, and I was on track to do just that… and then Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to the cancellation of TypeVille in Poland. I was quite disappointed about that cancellation—that trip would have been a *ton* of fun—but it was 100% the right call, and that mild disappoint is of course nothing compared to the horrors of war faced by Ukrainians. I would still like to find a venue for the talk I was prepping for TypeVille, “Types as Tools for Thought”: I think the material is good and worth getting out into the world.[^also-essay] I did still give one talk at EmberConf: [The Road to TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOw7TydAT_s).

I hosted no podcasts this year, but I did *appear* on two podcasts this year:

- [Whiskey, Web, and Whatnot: Bringing Types to Ember with Chris Krycho](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/bringing-types-to-ember-with-chris-krycho/), in which we had a nice discussion about some of the same themes as my EmberConf talk… and also [a solid whiskey](https://www.oldforester.com/products/old-forester-1920-style-prohibition-whisky/) I have slowly enjoyed through the rest of the year.

- [Rustacean Station: New Rustacean with Chris Krycho](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/chris-krycho/), in which I chatted with one of the hosts of the Rustacean Station podcast about what I have been up to in and around [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) since wrapping up [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com) a few years ago. We talked about [Volta](https://volta.sh), the possibilities afforded by and challenges presented by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org), where Rust is and is not a good fit and why it has not been a large part of my day job lately, and also some details about how I did podcasting. It was fun to podcast about Rust again!

Finally, I also published a number of videos to YouTube—something more or less totally new for me! Some of those came out of work: whenever I’m doing or explaining something for open source that I think can benefit others, I am trying to record it and publish it, like in [Wacky Tricks We Use in Publishing TypeScript Types (in Ember.js)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuF3GY-Ho-s) or some of the [streaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcGLjD0WQ1o) I have done.

The biggest video I published was [Work tracking with Obsidian embeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByvJSzY6U1w), a complement to my post [Writing Down What I Do — In Obsidian](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/writing-down-what-i-do-in-obsidian/). It’s small by YouTube standards (about 3.4k views as of this writing), but that is pretty decent traction given I have very few subscribers and no regular posting habit. I plan to do more of both of those kinds of things in the future: again, they *complement* the writing work I do here.

[^also-essay]: I would also like to get that same material written up as an essay. An essay form would have very different strengths and weaknesses than a conference talk, and—critically—would be different from just having a *transcript* of the talk. I think that basic approach and format, of paired essay and talk, is one I would like to explore a lot more in the next half decade.
