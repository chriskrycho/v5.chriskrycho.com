I was thinking this morning on the relationship between shorter-form and longer-form writing, and the difference in the value they offer to readers *and* writers.

Longer-form writing is often significantly more valuable, for a couple reasons well-highlighted by this exchange on Twitter:

> I tend to get disproportionately more from long blog posts than I do from short posts, because it's often surprising which seemingly minor detail(s) end up resonating with me, and those details seem to end up missing when spread across multiple posts.
>
> > Despite not looking for short-form writing advice (which is rarely useful), it's become so trendy to tell people to write shorter pieces that I ran across this advice thrice last week.
> >
> > As a general, unnuanced, dictum, this strikes me as very bad advice; the opposite of correct.

I agree with basically everything Tratt and Regehr get at there, and agree with a lot of Luu’s original point as well. There’s a reason [Mere Orthodoxy][mere-o]—unofficial tagline “defending word counts and nuance on the internet since 2005”—is so dear to my heart.

At the same time, I have been deeply appreciating [Matt Rickard’s blogging][mr] since I ran across his site a few months ago. Nearly everything he publishes is just a few hundred words long. None of it has anything like the technical depth of one of [Luu’s deep dives][luu] or [Hillel Wayne’s write-ups][wayne]. It’s neither better nor worse inherently, though: it is *wildly different*. Rickard is throwing off summaries and knowledge (more like an old-school late ’00s blogger!), Luu and Wayne are writing essays. The difference is mostly breadth vs. depth.

[luu]: https://danluu.com
[wayne]: https://www.hillelwayne.com

That means that I learn about *many* more things from Rickard than I do from Luu or Wayne; but I learn much more about *each* thing from Luu or Wayne.

One takeaway I have: the vast majority of my writing on this site over the past couple years has been in the longer-form mode, save the occasional short book review. Mixing it up to include the throwing-off-knowledge mode pieces *and* the longer-form deeper dives seems good. I have a *lot* of things which *could* be essays (and maybe someday will), but which could also benefit people by being in the world in the meantime. Here’s to trying to publish more like that in the months ahead.
