Once again, this morning I had high hopes of being able to sit down and make some serious progress today on the symphonic work I have been so very slowly making progress on over the last past 18 months or so—and was utterly stymied by the needs of my kids. It is still possible I will be able to get something done today, but realistically I have to content myself with the idea that I will not.

This has become an increasingly common experience for me over the past decade, as my now 10- and 8-year-old daughters have grown. Before my children were born, I could do a *lot* in terms of side projects and hobbies. After my children were born, I could do *less*, but still quite a bit. Infants and very young children require a great deal of attention when they are awake, but they sleep a lot and have very few activities outside the house. The older my daughters have gotten, though, the more time it has required to be a good father to them. (Not that I am always a “good father” to them: but I very much *aim* to be.) They sleep less and have more activities. They squabble and need intervention more. Positively, they engage with us more, make clear their desire for our attention and conversation!

A friend joked this week of another thing we had been slow in getting to:

> Have you tried neglecting your responsibilities? I find that helps.

That sums it up pretty well! Hobbies and side projects and even entertainment all increasingly goes by the wayside as one’s responsibilities increase. That is not a bad thing _per se_, but it requires a real, sometimes large, change in expectations. Things I could perhaps have done in six months now take two or three years. Things I could have aimed to do in a year or two of side project work before children I now have to acknowledge may not even be attainable at all.

Sometimes I look at the output of other people on the internet and am astonished all the do. Then I remember that being a single person with no children and no particular outside responsibilities is a very different thing than being a married person with children and quite a few outside responsibilities. It is not reasonable for me to expect myself to be as generative as I once was, in three ways.

First, I simply have less time, of course. Second, and subtler, the time I do have is much less contiguous, which means activities which require sustained focus are harder to accomplish. Third, I am also more tired by the time I get to that time, having spent more mental and emotional energy on other things.

To other parents, then: remember this, and adjust your own expectations accordingly. And to others who are *not* parents, or whose children are still very young, I say to you what I wish I could say to myself years ago: do not pride yourself in comparison to others you see in different life stages. It really is very different. (And yes, this generalizes beyond parenting: people acting as caretakers for aging parents or ill friends or relatives similarly have less ability to do hobbies or side projects.)
