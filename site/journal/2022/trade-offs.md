title: Trade-offs
subtitle: >
    They are real; but too often offered as an excuse to avoid thinking rather than a reason to think harder.

Developers like to talk a lot about trade-offs, and they are not *wrong* to do so, but it is also an easy out, in at least two ways—

1. The actual work of software is about *choosing between trade-offs*. Simply to say “Well, there are tradeoffs” does not help identify (a) what the trade-offs are, (b) how they interact with each other, or (c) why one might choose to come down on one side or another of any given trade.

2. Not all tradeoffs are equal! It is truly the case that some things are *better* than other things. The language of “trade-offs” often obscures this. (Indeed: it is often deployed for precisely this reason.) A modern, high-level programming language is better than laboriously hand-authored machine code for nearly every purpose.

Trade-offs are (a) contextual and (b) subject to change over time, as conditions change. It is sometimes possible to shift the balance between two or more trade-offs with targeted investments of time or energy or both.

Put another way: “all things being equal, *A* and *B* have comparable upsides and downsides, just *different* ones” has two problems: All things are *never* equal; and: the differences do in fact matter. Responsible software engineering is about identifying what things are not equal and the way those differences matter, and making decisions accordingly.

And then living with the consequences.
