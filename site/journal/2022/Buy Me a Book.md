The *very* short version: as of this evening, I have switched from Patreon to [BuyMeACoffee][bmab]—and of course, I titled my support model “Buy Me a Book.” If you’d like to support my work, please [hop on over there][bmab]. (And if not, I am of course simply grateful you are reading!)

A bit of background and elaboration—

As has no doubt *long since* been obvious, Patreon isn’t actually quite the right fit for the way I do things—I very intentionally do not publish here on a schedule!—but the number of good games in town for support, including recurring support, were much lower when I set that up a few years ago than it is today.

Accordingly, inspired by [Alan Jacobs](https://blog.ayjay.org/buy-me-a-dragon/), I’m moving my official “support my work” flow over to [BuyMeACoffee][bmab], which is much more the right shape for this kind of support. It does not require ongoing commitments, though it does support memberships if I choose to reintroduce that at a point when it makes sense. It also has the big upside of letting me use [Stripe](https://stripe.com), which means that if I need to move in the future, I can just do it transparently without affecting existing financial supporters like this move did!

I will *not* be posting regularly on BuyMeACoffee: only for particularly important updates about the work I’m doing—for example, when I actually get around to publishing essays, put up videos or conference talks or the like.
