<div class="note">

I came across this in my notes by hitting the “show me a random note” button in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) this evening, and I was glad to come back across it; I’m sharing it straight out of my notes (unedited save to add a link to the book it references) in the hope it may be thought-provoking to you as well.

Stealing a page from Torrance’s [<cite>The Trinitarian Faith</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780567292193), p. 102: with creation and incarnation as two parts of a whole, how do we reflect *rightly* on the nature of vocation and especially creative action (including but not limited to what we call ‘art’)?

Related question: is *all* vocation (rightly understood) fundamentally creative? How, if so—and how is that shaped both by creation-incarnation and by the Fall? What is “vocation” vs. “job” or “work”; how does “toil” and “labor” intersect with God-given calling to work in making just as he did? Some work is restorative (medicine), some punitive, some only generative in a distorted way, some parasitic. But each of these is a function of living in a broken reality.

We adulate art because it seems more cleanly creative/generative?

And if that is so, it is *partly* right: it recognizes the true goodness of creative and generative activity. But it is partly *wrong* because it misses the way *all* human activity is meant to be that—albeit in dramatically varying expressions, of course. Parenting a child and refactoring code are both “not Art” but are also both *essentially* creative and generative.
