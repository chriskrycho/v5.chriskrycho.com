Thanksgiving week, I went off coffee cold turkey, and it *hurt*. It literally hurt.

Caffeine, though we don’t often think of it in these terms, is a drug—specifically, a stimulant.[^why] As a drug, it has withdrawal symptoms. There is of course the fatigue you’d expect, given caffeine is a stimulant. As bad or worse for me, though, are the headaches. (I hear the same from most people. The headaches are *bad*.) For over half a decade, I have been drinking an 8–10-ounce cup of coffee every morning. It is not a lot, but it is *consistent*. My body has gotten used to the hit. More than that: it has come to *rely* on the hit. Take away the daily dose, and the withdrawals set in.

Here’s the thing, though: I don’t normally drink coffee for the caffeine content the way many people do. I drink coffee because six and a half years ago I learned from [a genuinely great coffee shop][jubala] just how good coffee can be. That it’s a thing you might want to drink simply because it tastes good, the way you eat some foods not only because of your need for sustenance but for the joy of a delicious meal.

This also means that when the coffee around isn’t to my taste, I just don’t drink it! If the reason for drinking it is the goodness of the flavors, then not-good flavors take away the incentive entirely. My body doesn’t know or care why I’m hitting it with a dose of caffeine every day, though. The result is addiction and the associated withdrawal effects (however mild).

I have occasionally experienced caffeine withdrawals before. This time, though, I decided enough was enough. I want the freedom to be at full capacity regardless of whether I have light-roast single-origin beans and a good grinder and a pour-over setup. When we got back from our Virginia, I opted to *stay* off caffeine. I’m now drinking decaf every day instead.

This does come with a slight downside in that decaffeinating coffee does decrease its flavor slightly, and a more significant one in that there is far less variety of great decaf available. (A few places have started doing occasional batches of single-origin decafs, but by and large they’re mostly blends, because you lose enough flavor in the decaffeinating process that the economics don’t yet work out in general. [^shh]) As a compromise, I do allow myself a little of the caffeinated coffee we buy for my wife here and there, and one caffeinated shot of espresso in a week. By keeping it to that level of consumption, I am not re-developing the addiction. Having caffeine from time to time is fine; it’s the daily routine which triggers dependence.

There have been some unexpected upsides to dropping caffeine. I have long been a morning person anyway, but eliminating the caffeine dependency has made me much *more* awake and alert in the mornings. It seems that eliminating the need for a chemical stimulant has returned my body to a healthier base state. I also now get to enjoy coffee whenever I want, because decaf doesn’t keep me up at night. Some days I have a cup with breakfast; some days I don’t. Some days I make a cup at 4pm. Some days I have three cups! So far I have still had some every day, but I also eat eggs and drink milk every day; the point is that I don’t *need* it. And while I don’t get *quite* the same taste quality on a daily basis, I *do* still get to enjoy great coffees, but without the downsides. When we travel again in a week, I’ll be without a reliable source of good coffee in the mornings, but this time it won’t matter a bit.

[^why]: A point of interest: *why* don’t we usually think of coffee in these terms? Certainly its relatively mild effects as a stimulant and its relatively mild withdrawal symptoms are part of that; so too is its normalcy in life throughout much of the world. Are there others? I’m not sure.

[^shh]: They don’t make a big deal about this, and they reserve the right to change it at will, but at the *moment* [my favorite coffee shop][loyal] uses a single-origin coffee for their decaf. I can hardly say how happy this makes me.
