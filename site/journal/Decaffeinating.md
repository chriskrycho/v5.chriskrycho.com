Thanksgiving week, I went off coffee cold turkey, and it *hurt*. It literally hurt.

Caffeine, though we don’t often think of it in these terms because it is so integrated into our lives, is a drug. As a drug, it has withdrawal symptoms. The main one for most people—and certainly the main one for me—is headaches. Close behind is the one you’d expect on thinking about how we tend to use caffeine for an energy boost: a lasting sense of fatigue during the withdrawal days. For a couple days, I experienced both. It was not fun.

Over the past few years, my body has grown deeply used to having a dose of caffeine ever morning, and occasionally one midday or in the afternoon as well. Here’s the thing, though: the vast majority of the time, I don’t drink coffee for caffeine. I drink coffee because about six and a half years ago, I learned from [a genuinely great coffee shop][jubala] just how good coffee can be. That it’s a thing you might want to drink simply because it tastes good, the way you eat some foods not only because of your need for sustenance but for the joy of a delicious meal.

This also means that when the coffee around isn’t to my taste, I just don’t drink it! If the reason for drinking it is the goodness of the flavors, then not-good flavors take away the incentive entirely. But drinking coffee every day still produces addiction (however mild) and the associated withdrawal effects—regardless of the reasons for drinking it. So, during our Thanksgiving trip, when there was no coffee to my taste available, I had headaches and fatigue for days.

I have occasionally experienced the withdrawals before, and I have never enjoyed it. This time, though, I decided enough was enough: I want the freedom to be at full capacity regardless of whether I have light-roast single-origin beans and a good grinder and a pour-over setup. When we got back from our Virginia, I opted to *stay* off caffeine. I’m now drinking decaf every day instead. This does come with a slight downside in that decaffeinating coffee does decrease its flavor slightly, and a more significant one in that there is far less variety of great decaf available. (A few places have started doing occasional batches of single-origin decafs, but by and large they’re mostly blends, because you lose enough flavor in the decaffeinating process that the economics don’t yet work out in general. [^shh]) As a compromise, I do allow myself a little of the caffeinated coffee we buy for my wife here and there, and one caffeinated shot of espresso in a week. By keeping it to that level of consumption, I am not re-developing the addiction. Having caffeine from time to time is fine; it’s the daily routine which triggers dependence.

There have been some unexpected upsides to dropping caffeine. I have long been a morning person anyway, but eliminating the caffeine dependency has made me much *more* awake and alert in the mornings. It seems that eliminating the need for a chemical stimulant has returned my body to a healthier base state. I also now get to enjoy coffee whenever I want, because decaf doesn’t keep me up at night. Some days I have a cup with breakfast; some days I don’t. Some days I make a cup at 4pm. Some days I have three cups! So far I have still had some every day, but I also eat eggs and drink milk every day; the point is that I don’t *need* it. And while I don’t get *quite* the same taste quality on a daily basis, I *do* still get to enjoy great coffees, but without the downsides. When we travel again in a week, I’ll be without a reliable source of good coffee in the mornings, but this time it won’t matter a bit.

[^shh]: They don’t make a big deal about this, and they reserve the right to change it at will, but at the *moment* [my favorite coffee shop][loyal] uses a single-origin coffee for their decaf. I can hardly say how happy this makes me.
