Over the past few years, I have gradually started using the [Blue Oak Model License][blue-oak] for all new open source projects. Historically, I had always used the widespread [<abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> License][mit]. Since finding the Blue Oak license, though, I have come to very much prefer it, because it uses clearer language, skips the completely-unnecessary ALL CAPS in favor of using semantic markup (in Markdown or <abbr>HTML</abbr>), and comes with a patent license/waiver. In other words, it is similar in guarantees to the [<abbr>BSD</abbr> 2-Clause Plus Patent][bsd2p] license, but it is significantly easier to read.

The Blue Oak Model license is from the [Blue Oak Council][boc], which is an effort from, among others, [Kyle Mitchell][km]. The Council is an effort to publish educational materials as well as useful licenses for folks without super deep pockets to hire lawyers to wrangle all of that. Mitchell himself is well worth reading on software legal issues, and while I do not always agree with his social takes, his legal input on software licensing has been very informative and indeed formative for me over the past few years!

If you are looking for a permissive, non-viral license for your next open source project, I suggest seriously considering the Blue Oak Model license!
