[Buttondown][b] has been my tool of choice for several years now for sending “newsletter”-shaped content. I have a lot of emails set up with them![^perf] It is what I use for the [per-post][everything] and [weekly digest][digest] emails for this very site; it is what I use for [my music newsletter][music]; it is where I ran my weekly(ish) [Across the Sundering Seas][atss] in 2019–2020.[^atss-note]

[everything]: https://buttondown.com/sympolymathesy
[digest]: https://buttondown.com/sympolymathesy-digest
[music]: https://newsletter.music.chriskrycho.com
[atss]: https://buttondown.com/chriskrycho

It is fantastic! If newsletters are a thing you need to send, you should check it out! But, as their [Buttondown alternatives][alternatives] page says:

> Buttondown is a very useful, powerful tool — but it's not meant to be a one-size-fits-all tool. My philosophy in building Buttondown is to focus on doing a few things *really, really well* instead of trying to do *everything okay-ish*.

…and then it goes on to list a bunch of things you might consider using instead under all the conditions where Buttondown is *not* the best fit! It links to a bunch of offerings you would normally think of as (and which in some sense indeed are) *direct competitors* to Buttondown, like [Ghost][g] and [ConvertKit][c]!

[c]: https://kit.com

This is how I want *all* my tools to be. There is a ton of room in these markets for healthy and friendly competition—and no need at all for winner-take-all or monopolist attitudes.

[^perf]: Enough to occasionally trip over weird performance issues… which they promptly fix; they are a great team.

[^atss-note]: If you didn’t follow my work when I was writing [Across the Sundering Seas][atss], and you *like* my work—which I assume you do if you’re reading this footnote—you should go back and check out the archives. Some of my best writing is in those issues.
