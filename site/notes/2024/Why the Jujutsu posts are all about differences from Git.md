        Although this talks in terms of version control tools, you don’t really need to know anything about them. Substitute “flarble” for “Jujutsu”, “lubdub” for “Git”, and “hop waffle dancing” for “version control” and you would still get the gist.

    When writing about something which invites obvious comparisons to a “peer” in its category, it is natural to emphasize what is different and novel.

Extracted from [a discussion thread on lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/zgs3uo/jujutsu_megamerges_jj_absorb):

A lot of the focus in write-ups about [jj](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) right now (certainly including mine!) is on what you can do in jj which is difficult or impossible in Git. By nature, that means it focuses on things which are *different* from your normal/existing Git workflows. That can be a bit misleading, though, because it can implicitly suggest that the “normal” Git work flow is difficult or problematic in some way! In point of fact, basically all of the work flows folks are used to from Git are equally doable, and often simpler, in Jujutsu. It’s just that they seem less notable, not only in terms of things I think to share—“oh, this would be a neat thing for people to see!”—but also in terms of what people are likely to *read*. 

“Jujutsu does the same thing as Git with roughly the same number of commands” is not exactly likely to get a lot of discussion (on Hacker News or lobste.rs or social media) or even to get *read*.

That said, I think I will make a point to incorporate some of that in future posts (and, hopefully, videos) to help people see more clearly that they’re not *giving up* things from Git but rather *keeping* the things Git offers *and also gaining others*.

This is a fairly general dynamic—when writing about something which invites obvious comparisons to a “peer” in its category, it is natural to emphasize what is different and novel rather than what is the same.
