        People know a bit about image file formats and use Appleâ€™s Shared Albums feature.

Pro tip: Apple Photos supports <span class="all-smcp">JPEG-XL</span>, but the [Shared Albums][sa] feature appears *not* to. ðŸ˜‚

![Well, this is distinctly not what I was going for.](https://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/apple-photos-jpeg-xl.png "A screenshot of the Apple Photos app, showing a set of photo thumbnails in an album in the Shared Albums section, titled 2024 Krycho Thanksgiving. Nearly all the photos are mostly gray noise, with seeminly-random bits of color in them.")

This is implicitly documented by Apple on their page about Shared Albums, because <span class="all-smcp">JPEG-XL</span> is not on the list of supported file types, but it still surprised me!
