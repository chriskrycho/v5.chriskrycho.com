I just added a brief section to the colophon of this site. It reads:

There are any number of places I think generative <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> tools are potentially legitimate to employ and deploy (you can expect to hear a fair bit more from me on that front in 2025–2026). My writing is not on that list, however. My writing is *mine*. It is not, and will never be—must never be!—a cobbled-together mishmash of statistical regularities.

The only time you would ever see output from an <abbr title="large language model">LLM</abbr> here is if I am using it (explicitly) to illustrate a point about <abbr title="large language model">LLM</abbr>s.

Every word on this site is now and always will be one I explicitly chose to put here: because I wrote it myself or because I am quoting someone else.
