A thing I learned years and years ago, then forgot, and remembered only recently: nearly any text field on a Mac has access to macOS’s built-in spell checking functionality. (Exceptions are usually a sign of something weird about the text field!)

- <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>:</kbd> triggers **Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar**

- <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>;</kbd> triggers **Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Check Document Now**, which steps sequentially through any detected spelling and grammar issues in the document.

I had recently been mucking around a bit with [Grammarly][g] but honestly found it to be too intrusive, and the constant up-sells to Pro and their <abbr>LLM</abbr>-based tooling are extremely annoying. The reality is: for my purposes, the built-in spelling and grammar checker should catch 99% of the things I care about!
