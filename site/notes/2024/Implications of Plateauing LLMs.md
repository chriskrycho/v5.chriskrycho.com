Apropos of this comment [from Simon Willison][sw]:

> I’ve been mostly unconvinced by the ongoing discourse around LLMs hitting a plateau. The areas I’m personally most excited about are multi-modality (images, audio and video as input) and model efficiency. Both of those have had enormous leaps forward in the past year.
>
> I don’t particularly care about “AGI”. I want models that can do useful things that I tell them to, quickly and inexpensively—and that’s exactly what I’ve been getting more of over the past twelve months.
>
> Even if progress on these tools entirely stopped right now, the amount I could get done with just the models I’ve downloaded and stashed on a USB drive would keep me busy and productive for years.

Things which can be true about generative <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>/<abbr title="large language model">LLM</abbr>s at the same time:

- Scaling may be “done”, in the sense that the past few years’ rapid increase in *capabilities* by creating *larger models* with *more data* may no longer hold.

- There is still significant untapped potential for improving the “scaling” of these models in the sense of being able to get a given level of performance with significantly less “compute”—running models that are comparable in performance to last year’s frontier models on a beefy laptop is now possible.

- Even if the models do not improve via scaling in the first sense *at all*, the implications of what already exist will take years to work out in detail, and there is—for all the *many* problems with generative <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, nonetheless some real potential there.

- Whether that potential is worth the costs is a separate but equally important question: the current training regime is quite possibly illegal and in my view certainly unethical. That does not mean that holds for the *technology*.

- Many of the ways it is currently deployed are *also* unethical.
