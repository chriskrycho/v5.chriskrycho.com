The Rust Project has [launched][post] the [2024 State of Rust Survey]({{link}}). If you are someone who has thoughts on Rust—whether because you love it and want to see it succeed, or because you have a laundry list of reasons you *don’t* use it—I strongly encourage you to take the survey. It should only take a few minutes (it took me about seven), and the feedback gathered from the survey each year is quite valuable in helping set priorities and direction for the project.

If you’re skeptical about these kinds of surveys, I will just add that when I was on a team focused on developer experience at LinkedIn, we took our internal versions of these surveys *incredibly* seriously. Both the individual questions we chose to ask and the responses offered in freeform text fields provided some of the very best and most helpful information about what problems to tackle, or how to tackle them, that we got in any shape or forum.

Full disclosure: Although I am not directly involved with this survey, I am part of the Rust project (via my work on [<cite>The Rust Programming Language</cite>][book]), so yes, I am biased! I want you to take it so we can all keep making the project better.
