Apple’s App Store App of the Year award choices have been making me quirk my eyebrows a bit for a few years now, but this one really takes the cake: this year’s [Mac App of the Year][app] is Adobe Lightroom. What a terrible choice!

[app]: https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1781083473

Now, look: I use Lightroom for most of my photo editing (I have considered switching to something like Capture One but haven’t actually done so), and it is a good tool. What it is not:

- Particular Mac-native; its controls are nearly all Adobe-specific cross-platform approaches.

- A particularly good Mac citizen even apart from that. Working with the Finder? Ha! Integrating with iCloud? Ha! 

- *In need of support from Apple.* This is one of the biggest, oldest players in software, which makes billions of dollars a year. It does not need any marketing from another huge tech player.

The write-up is pretty lame, too. (To be clear: I am not blaming whoever got handed the work of writing it up, but rather whoever made this call.) The piece emphasizes <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-based edits—which tells you what Apple cares about right now, presumably because it is what Apple thinks Wall Street and the press care about.

Put more bluntly: Highlighting an app that is a powerful tool with a bunch of AI features but not a great Mac app says a lot about Apple’s priorities. They are not great.

I really wish Apple would do better than this. Highlight great Mac-native apps from companies that could actually use the boost. If you want developers to love your platform, *give them a reason to*. This isn’t it.
