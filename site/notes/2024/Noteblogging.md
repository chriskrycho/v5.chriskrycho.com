    Noteblogging is what I am doing in my “Notes” section, and that Simon Willison does every day: blog as public notebook and notes to friends.

For the past few weeks, I have been posting much more frequently, in a revived “Notes” section on this site. I have not been quite sure what to call this format, which I borrowed most directly from [Simon Willison][sw], and secondarily from [Tom MacWright][tmcw]. It is not quite microblogging as I tend to think of it, though Tom files it under “micro”. It is also not quite what I think of as “regular” blogging (macro-blogging?). It is more at the level of the ind of thing I jot down in my notebook, or might send over to a friend in a quickly-typed up note, which is why I filed it under the “Notes” section of my website.

Noteblogging
: If I learn something, or I think of something I know but realize might not be obvious to some of my readers, I write up a short post. It takes me between 5 and 15 minutes—longer than that, and I move it to a different bucket. I publish it <abbr title="as soon as possible">ASAP</abbr>, after doing a minimal grammar and spelling check. The point is simply to get the thing into the world with as little friction as possible—but not (or at least not only) on social media.

Writing an email referencing it just a few minutes ago, I half-jokingly called it “noteblogging”, and then I realized that “noteblogging” is actually a pretty good name for this. All of these are basically “public notebooks”, *not* in the sense of [Andy Matuschak’s carefully-curated *notes system*][am] but in the sense of notes we might write for ourselves or for a colleague, and which we are instead sharing publicly. *Not* a [public Zettelkasten][z], exactly, but something adjacent to it.

As I said when I started doing this, these kinds of “notes” get about a tenth as much time and attention as one of my Journal entries,[^journal] which in turn get about a tenth as much time and attention as one of my Essays. “Noteblogging” feels like it captures the feel pretty well. Henceforth, then: noteblogging it is!

Which is also a good time to say: if you are not doing this kind of noteblogging, I encourage you to try it. It is a great way to share the kinds of things you might post about on social media, and a noteblog post can be the foundation of a good social media post or thread in its own right, while making sure you [own your turf][turf].

[^journal]: I probably need a better name for the Journal section at some point—there is not a particularly clear distinction between “notes” and “journals”, after all—but the distinction will serve well enough for now.
