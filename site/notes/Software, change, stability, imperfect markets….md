    I take it as given you know what 1Password is and have some familiarity with their history for a couple paragraphs, but you can probably infer.

While I understand why 1Password pivoted, these past few years, toward enterprise features from the point of view of their business—especially with Apple and others providing decent basic password management—I really, *really* miss the days when 1Password was an exemplary, and awesome, Mac and iOS app. There is no comparable replacement!

It’s plausible to me that there wasn’t a sustainable business in the original space 1Password was playing in. Plausible, I say: not especially *persuasive*. It’s hard not to notice that the push into growth came with investment. It’s hard not to conclude that the folks who founded the company wanted to make something bigger than 1Password used to be. _Cf._ Allen Pike’s [Building Something Big][bsb]. I can understand that, to a degree. I like working on big, hard things in software myself. (Though if I could fund indie work on the kinds of things I love to work on, I would.)

Whenever this happens, though, I think about the customers left behind. I have heard many a business-minded person (including some indie developers!) make the case that the owner of a business does not owe it to their customers to *continue* making the kind of app they started out making. I don’t think I entirely agree with that.

For one thing: Markets are not guaranteed to provide perfect substitutes. If a company pivots, or goes off the rails, or simply shuts down, there is an *opportunity* for a competitor to fill that space. Opportunity is not the same thing as a guarantee, though.

For another: software is not quite like other things we buy. If I buy a chair, it will presumably keep working until it breaks. Taken care of well, that could be decades—or more! The same is simply not true of software, which must be kept up to date to continue working with new operating systems on new hardware. (These are things we could change structurally, too: but they are beyond any individual software developer or buyer’s control.) That exact reality underpins much of the move to subscription pricing for software in the past decade. But a subscription feels that much more painful when the thing I subscribe to changes what it offers me.

This is one more reason that paying for software once—or in subscription models with [off ramps][off]—seems a much squarer deal for the people *buying* the software. If you bought [Dorico][d] v5, it will never be updated to work smoothly on macOS Tahoe, whereas I expect Dorico v6 *will* be. But then, if you don’t update to Tahoe,[^tahoe] you can keep using Dorico 5 indefinitely. It will never break or change out from under you. That *matters*.

[^tahoe]: I might say more about this later, but as of right this minute… I am not planning to update to Tahoe at the 26.0 release, and it’s entirely plausible I won’t update to *any* of the 26.x releases. The new features are nice, but the design is a mess to say the least. I may wait till macOS 27 in hopes that they at least iterate a bit. I have been a regular updater for my entire run on macOS, so it really says something that I am simply going to opt out of this update for the foreseeable future.
