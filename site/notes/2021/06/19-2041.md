[StaffPad] is quickly becoming my favorite tool for composing. Its handwriting recognition is *far* from perfect, but itâ€™s the best thing Iâ€™ve found for *writing music* (much the way I would on paper!) while still having digital affordances.

Bonus: pair it with the [Spitfire instruments][sso]â€¦ ðŸ¤©
