One reason I’m keen on programming languages as a tool for advancing software development is because *reversion to the mean* is real: working in JavaScript, I see daily how language affordances can make it easy for developers to do things which are terrible for maintenance… and make it *hard* for developers to do things which are good for maintenance, for just one example.

I could, and perhaps in a future post *will*, expand on a list of other things language affordances affect! The key, though, is the recognition that language affordances matter enormously, even if “you can write FORTRAN in any language.”
