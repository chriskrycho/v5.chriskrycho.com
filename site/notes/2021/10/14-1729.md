Spent my entire afternoon chasing down a bug which ended up being resolved by [a tiny fix](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/pull/1503/files). But bugs are often tiny: the tricky bit isnâ€™t (necessarily) the amount of code involved, but the many, many details you have to keep straight to avoid (or fix) them.
