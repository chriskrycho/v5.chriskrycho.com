Recorded my [EmberConf 2021](https://emberconf.com) talk, [â€˜Keep It Localâ€™](https://emberconf.com/schedule/day-1_keep-it-local) yesterday. It is *easily* the best talk Iâ€™ve ever given, and the one Iâ€™m proudest of. I dare say that it actually says something meaningfully *new* about software development: synthesizing many streams into a single coherent story. ðŸ˜… Mad props to Jaimie Krycho for helping me nail down everything from personal style to lighting for the recording!
