Two tools Iâ€™ve found invaluable while coordinating and leading a large migration on the LinkedIn flagship web app over the last few months:

- [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv): a ridiculously speedy command-line CSV manipulation tool
- [vscode-edit-csv](https://github.com/janisdd/vscode-edit-csv): a fabulous VS Code extension which lets you work with CSVs like spreadsheets within the editor
