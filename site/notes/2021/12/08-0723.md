Status: really, *really* wishing that ES modules supported `export default const foo = 123`. It would be nice for many things, but it would be *especially* nice for the Ember [First Class Component Templates proposal](https://github.com/chriskrycho/ember-rfcs/blob/fcct/text/0779-first-class-component-templates.md).
