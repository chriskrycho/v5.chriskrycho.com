For as long as I have been composing, I have notionally composed for live players. Despite the rarity of that opportunity with orchestras, and the fact that all my high school works were *actually* composed and performed for Clavinova Festivals, I've only really just seriously considered taking composing *purely* digitally as its own distinct medium.
