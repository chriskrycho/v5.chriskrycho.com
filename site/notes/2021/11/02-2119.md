What I was planning to do this quarter at work was 100% driving forward [TypeScript][ts] in [Ember][ember] and [Glimmer][glimmer] for us. What I’m actually doing a ton of is «checks notes» fixing memory leaks, because they’re causing our test suite to explode.

[ember]: https://emberjs.com/
[glimmer]: https://glimmerjs.com

REWRITE IT ALL IN [RUST][rust]! ALL OF IT! ALLL!
