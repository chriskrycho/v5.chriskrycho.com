Pro tip for triggering a good old beach ball on a shiny new M1 Max MacBook Pro (but not for *that* long, considering):

Open a large orchestral score in [Dorico][d] and then apply the [Spitfire <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> <abbr title="Symphony Orchestra">SO</abbr> Pro][s] playback [template][t] to it. 😂

(To be clear: the results here are *incredible*, though—it just *goes*. Effortlessly. I can’t wait to see what it’s like running the Apple Silicon-native versions of these as they come out in the next few months.)
