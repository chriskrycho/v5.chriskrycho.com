Current hobby: opening <abbr title="musical instrument digital interface">MIDI</abbr> files from my high school composing, swapping in new, *excellent* sound libraries (yes, nearly all from [Spitfire][s] ðŸ˜‚), and seeing how much better they sound even otherwise reworking them. Spoilers: way better.
