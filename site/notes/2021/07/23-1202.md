Finally sorted out my [<abbr title="secure sockets layer (encryption for internet traffic)">SSL</abbr> issues][prev]—after almost an hour. (*Not* [Ghost’s][ghost] fault, just exposed by Ghost.) The fix:

- upgrade [acme.sh][acme]
- find and update a defunct server location in a per-site config

No one who doesn’t do this stuff for a living would ever have been able to fix this.
