The more time I spend with other apps (looking at you today, [StaffPad][s]), the more persuaded I am that [Dorico][d]'s model, where notes are primary and measures are arbitrary, *secondary* groupings—layered on top of the notes—is both more correct and more *useful* design than the bars-first approach nearly every other notation software takes.
