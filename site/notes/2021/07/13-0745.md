One thing I discovered immediately upon [importing a score from StaffPad to Dorico][prev] is that while I really *like* the [Spitfire Symphony Orchestra][sso] samples I have for StaffPad… I *looooove* Spitfire’s [<abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> Symphony Orchestra][bbcso] samples. 🎵
