Needed to update the server behind [JaimieKrycho.com][jk] today (something about old <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> versions and being a good internet citizen). Terminal-only wasâ€¦ fineâ€¦ but painful. So I set up [VS Code Remote][vscr] on the [Linode][linode] serverâ€”it took ~2 minutesâ€”and had all my normal editor tools available. ðŸ”¥
