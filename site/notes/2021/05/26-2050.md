Just published a small experiment I’ve been mulling on for the past week or so: [ember-simple-track-helper][npm]. It’s basically the same idea as [React’s `useState` hook][useState], for Glimmer and Ember “template-only components”—places you don’t *really* need a backing class.

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-simple-track-helper
[useState]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html

(As with *all* my recent packages, this is following [the spec for SemVer for TypeScript][spec] I have been working on. So far it’s working well! Hopefully-final revisions to that <abbr title="request for comments">RFC</abbr> inbound in the weeks ahead!)

[spec]: https://github.com/chriskrycho/ember-rfcs/blob/semver-for-ts/text/0730-semver-for-ts.md
