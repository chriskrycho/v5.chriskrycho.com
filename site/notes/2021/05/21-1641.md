The kind of day I’m having: I went searching for literature on semantic versioning for dependent types. As far as I can tell, there’s literally nothing[^1]—and as my friend [Dan Freeman](https://twitter.com/__dfreeman) pointed out, it’d probably be a 🍾 moment if they were in broad enough use to have this literature. 😂

In related news: conceptualizing type narrowing in TypeScript as write operations on types in the flow-control-based subset of dependent typing which TS enables has proven profitable for resolving a previously-intractable conceptual problem about SemVer for TS I was having. 😂

[^1]: The top hit on both [DuckDuckGo][ddg] and [Google][g] for the search query `"semantic versioning" "dependent types"` is… [me](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/elsewhere/rfc-semver-for-typescript-types/). 😬
