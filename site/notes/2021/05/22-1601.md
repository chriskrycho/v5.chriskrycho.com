When you start reading [an introductory tutorial][incr] with a section title like “\<some topic\> in a Nutshell”… and the third paragraph is about ⅔ incomprehensible to you. 😅 Time to go see if I can get my head at least a *little* bit around how [functor modules][functor] work in [OCaml][ocaml]. (And yes: put the relevant bits into [Anki][anki]!)
