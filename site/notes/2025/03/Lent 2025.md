A note to reader who also follow me on social media: I am signing out of social media for Lent, as I do also during Advent and at least once in mid-summer. (See [here][returning] for some background on this discipline!) I will still be writing and posting regularly here and on [my music newsletter][newsletter].

From the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, International Edition:

> **The First Day of Lent, Commonly Called Ash Wednesday.**  
> *The Collect.*  
> Almighty and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast made, and dost forgive the sins of all those who are penitent: Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Grace and peace to all of you!
