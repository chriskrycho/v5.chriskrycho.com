Robin Sloan, being his usual deeply-thoughtful self on <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> systems: [Is It Okay?]({{link}}). From the opening, just enough to give you a taste of what you need to read the rest of:

> On the side of “yes, it’s okay”, I will insist that the analogy to human learning is not admissible. “Don’t people read things, and learn from them, and produce new work?” Yes, but speed and scale always influence our judgments about safety and permissibility, and the speed and scale of machine learning is off the charts. No human, no matter how well-read, could ever field requests from a million other people all at once, forever.
>
> As our case is new, so we must think anew.
>
> On the side of “no, it’s not okay”, I will set aside any arguments grounded in copyright law. Not because they are irrelevant, but because … well, I think modern copyright is deeply flawed, so a victory on those grounds would be thin, a bit sad. Instead, I’ll defer to deeper precedents: the intuitions and aspirations that gave rise to copyright in the first place. *To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts*, remember?
>
> I hope partisans of both sides will agree this is a fair swap. Put down your weapons, and let’s think together.

As it happens, I think Robin is probably pretty much correct in his assessment, including his *perfect* delivery of one paraticular assessment late in the piece. [Give it a read.]({{link}})
