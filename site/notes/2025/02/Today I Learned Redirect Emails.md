Today I learned that you can not only *forward* emails, but can also *redirect* them. I was making a small tweak to the Apple Mail client’s menu bar items for unrelated reasons and saw the **Redirect** button as an option and thought, “What in the world is *redirect*?” [Apple’s support document][apple] explains:

> Only the address of the original sender is shown to the recipient, and the recipient’s reply goes only to the original sender.

Both [Lifewire][lifewire] and [Cult of Mac][cult-of-mac] have a bit more on using this. It is a neat feature! I am not sure when I would use it, exactly, but I like that it exists.

One big upside: when you do this, replies *automatically* go to the original person instead of to you. It’s like preemptively setting yourself to <abbr title="blind carbon copy">BCC</abbr> for people to whom you forward the email. So maybe one potential use case would be forwarding along a message that is more relevant to someone else, while still including some introductory text or the like, in exactly that kind of situation.

This is also be supported in other clients, possibly including whatever client you use, but Mail is the one I use!
