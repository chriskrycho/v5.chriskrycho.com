summary: >
    Someone asked whether I’ve looked into integrating this site with my notes system; I don’t. Here’s what I do instead!

qualifiers:
    audience: |
        People with at least vague familiarity with static site generators and plain text notes systems, and interest in publishing using things other than “stnrdard”/“normal” tools like WordPress or Ghost.

Just now, someone asked me:

> Did you ever consider authoring or publishing your blog directly from Obsidian sources, or I guess any other note-taking software?

My reply—

I have debated it, and some folks do it. Cassidy Williams [does](https://cassidoo.co/post/publishing-from-obsidian/), for example. In the end, Obsidian and I don’t get along _quite_ well enough for it to work for me for that kind of flow, so I end up doing a couple different things.

1. These days, everything but “Essays” lives in a “Drafts and Ideas” folder in iCloud Drive so I can edit it with any text editor on any of my devices. I tend to work on them in some mix of BBEdit and Byword and occasionally Zed or Nova on Mac, and usually 1Writer or Textastic on iOS.

2. Essays tend to get worked on in [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), just because something about its library management works well for me for dealing with things that require that level of structure and polish.

In either case, once they’re ready to publish, I add relevant metadata (publish date etc.) and just drag them into the folder for my site generator, do a quick spot check, and then commit and push. (With jj, of course. 😅)

That keeps it low _enough_ friction for me, and I can still have Obsidian or Bear (I keep going back and forth 🥴) for notes in a more traditional sense and pull those in.

Every time I talk about any of this I want to figure out how to fund [my old “integrated writing environment” software](https://rewrite.software/) idea.
