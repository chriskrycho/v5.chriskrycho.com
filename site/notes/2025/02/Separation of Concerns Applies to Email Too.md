Yesterday evening, I posted [a note][prev] about “separation of concerns” for my registrar, <abbr>DNS</abbr> provider, and. I just added these two notes to it:

[prev]: https://v5.chriskrycho.com/notes/separation-of-concerns/

Equally critical to my mind: I do not run my email (hello@\<whichever domain> etc.) through my registrar *or* my <abbr>DNS</abbr> provider, but another service. In my case, that’s Fastmail, but it could be basically anything: Proton, Google Apps, Outlook, whatever. The point is that my email is, like every other part of this stack, *not* coupled to the other parts of it!

If you found that original post (or this one!) helpful and decide to use Hover or Fastmail, these affiliate links will get me a little off my next renewal and give you a small discount:
