I just came across [this tutorial](https://github.com/jkoppel/jj-workshop) for getting up to speed on common workflows with Jujutsu. I have yet to work through it myself, so this is a limited recommendation rather than a full-throated one, but at first blush it looks great. I have touched on fancy moves you can make with `jj` and of course did [my mammoth introduction](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/jj-init/) to it early last year, but we have very much needed more truly introductory materials like this! If you have been waiting for a better "how to get started" to help you get started, this looks like it might be it.
