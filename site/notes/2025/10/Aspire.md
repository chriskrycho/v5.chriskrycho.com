Robin Sloan’s [Aspire Zine](https://www.robinsloan.com/shop/aspire-zine/) is, unfortunately, sold out. The thesis—which he has long included as the description of [his own website](https://www.robinsloan.com)’s approach to (not) tracking you—is one I could not support more vigorously:

> Information technology should aspire to the speed & privacy of the printed page.

I think it is fair to say that most purveyors of information technology do *not* aspire to anything of the sort. But they (we!) should.

The page for the zine includes this teaser:

> The zine comes with access to a digital version, delivered in a way that I think is healthier and more interesting than the current model.

And the zine itself includes this line:

> There’s nothing virtuous or natural about the behaviors of computer systems. Engineers have toiled across decades to mold those behaviors. Everything is a choice.

Robin has made some interesting and novel choices! So if you want to read it, [email me](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20read%20Robin%20Sloan%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CAspire%E2%80%9D%20Zine). (This is, trust me, very much in keeping with the spirit of the thing.)
