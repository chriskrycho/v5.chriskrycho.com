Two days ago, I finished drafting the third movement of my first symphony. Lots of revision ahead!

A few select statistics about this third movement as it stands now:

- Bars: 288
- Notes: 10,832
- Dynamics: 1,358
- Trills: 21
- Duration: 8′52″

Four years since I started on it, and I’m steadily making good progress. This is how creative work gets done when it is not your day job: a little at a time. More in [my music newsletter][newsletter] next week. Up next: something else as a palette cleanser!
