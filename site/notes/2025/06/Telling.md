I think itâ€™s very telling that a lot of people treat me as *anti*-<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and *anti*-<abbr title="large language model">LLM</abbr> just because I am not *vigorously pro-<abbr>LLM</abbr>*: because I want to approach new technologies in careful, measured ways; because I do not believe the myth of technological inevitability and instead affirm that we have both agency and responsibility as builders and users of technology; because I am measured and restrained in my evaluations; because I do not believe the (apparent or actual) utility of a technology is the only relevant consideration.
