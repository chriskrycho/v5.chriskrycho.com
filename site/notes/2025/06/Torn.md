Status: I deeply love *both* [Frame Text](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/frame) and [MD Lórien](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-lorien/), and am therefore having a small crisis about which one is going to be the main typeface for v6.chriskrycho.com when it arrives (not *very* soon—most likely sometime later this year).

(This is all [Robin Sloan][rs]’s fault. I was happily moving forward with Frame Text until he wrote about the excellencies of MD Lórien in a recent [newsletter issue][newsletter] and demonstrated those excellencies in [a recent zine][zine]. A terrible kind of gift!)
