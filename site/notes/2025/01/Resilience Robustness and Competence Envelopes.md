The story itself was all-too familiar to me from an incident I led in 2023 at LinkedIn. Most of the details are different (though the phrase “<abbr>OOM</abbr> Killer” is still enough to make me a little twitchy), but the big picture is likely to be very familiar to *anyone* who has worked through a “thundering-herd”-style incident.
