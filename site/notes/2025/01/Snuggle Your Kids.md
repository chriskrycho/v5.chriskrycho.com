Yesterday was a frustrating day. I got another “no” in my job search—this one ultimately framed as a “not yet, because we aren’t yet ready to hire for the role we think you’d actually be great in”. That’s encouraging in a way, but it doesn’t pay the bills in the meantime, and so the job search continues. I was pretty down.

After our family devotions yesterday evening, I just sat on our couch and snuggled and laughed with my daughters for another ten minutes. Lots of joking about nothing. A bit of mild teasing about “oh, but is that boy you just named *cute*?” with my elder daughter. A bit of my younger doing the kinds of happy fits of giggles and bouncing. And, when all was said and done, a lot warmer and happier state of my heart.

I was still feeling pretty discouraged. (I still am!) But with a lot more joy mixed in, and the reminder that *these people* and *this life* are why I am throwing myself back into the maelstrom of the job search. Our work is good, and having a “yes” on a job at some point will be a great relief and a great joy; but moments like that one with my girls are by far the most important parts of life.
