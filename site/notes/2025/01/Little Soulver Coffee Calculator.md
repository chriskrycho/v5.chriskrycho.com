One of my favorite little Mac and iOS tools is [Soulver][soulver]. Billed as part notepad and part calculator, you could think of it as a *vastly* simpler spreadsheet that uses text instead of cells. I use it all the time for little calculations, whether for work or, more commonly, for things like running pace calculations or little things around the house.[^notes] For example, my coffee calculator.

I make pour-over coffee pretty much every morning (the rare exception being when I go off to a coffee shop and get some espresso), and I have baseline recipes dialed in long since. However, sometimes I have some random weight of beans left over when hitting the end of a bag. Unless it happens to be a pretty clean ratio to one of the weights I use as the starting point for any given coffee, I need to do some math to figure out how much water I ought to use and roughly how many ounces of drinkable coffee “yield” I ought to expect as a result. It's not perfect, of course, but it's a great starting point.

This little calculator is something you could do many other ways, but Soulver makes it *really* easy. You can [download this particular sheet directly][calculator] if you like, but of course you can also see here how easy it was to make! So if you’re on macOS or iOS, you should absolutely snag [Soulver][soulver]: it is inexpensive and invaluable.

[^notes]: The Math Notes feature in the latest versions of the Notes app on Apple platforms can do a subset of what Soulver can do, but it is *much* less robust, especially in terms of its ability to interpret equations, name variables, and so on. If you have liked Math Notes, you will *love* Soulver.
