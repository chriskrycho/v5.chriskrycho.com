summary: >
    Inspiration is not always conscious; sometimes we cannot even say what it is we want to try artistically until we are already trying it.

This morning after wrapping up breakfast, I had the urge to walk over to my piano and sketch an idea for a little musical them. On the moment the urge took me, I had no particular idea in mind. I was certainly not thinking of a tune. I was not consciously thinking of anything, really. The moment I opened the keyboard of the piano and set my fingers on the keys, though, a little melody popped out: fully formed as an idea immediately.

I played it, decided I liked it, played it again to fix it in my mind, then bolted to the other room to grab my iPad and notate it down in [Dorico][dorico-for-ipad] before it got away from me. Three minutes later, I had done just that.

This sort of experience is what we name “inspiration”, I think. It is not, in its own right, sufficient to create a good piece of art—even if I also think most great art has at least a dash of this in it. What caught my attention as I reflected on the process was that some part of me *did* have the idea. I *wanted* to go to the piano just then, though I could not have told you why. I *knew* at some level that I had a musical idea, though I could not have hummed it. It was “subconscious”—perhaps *pre*-conscious.

It is not always this way. Sometimes a musical idea will first rise to the level of consciousness, and then I will try to write it out, whether with piano, paper, and pencil or with Dorico and a <abbr title="musical instrument digital interface">MIDI</abbr> keyboard. Curiously, I am rarely successful at fully translating from my mind into notation in those attempts, but I think that is merely a matter of skill. I need to practice more!

When I *do* get the inexplicable, inarticulate urge to go work something out on the piano, though, I have learned to trust that feeling. Not every idea that comes this way is a keeper, but I want to at least give it a chance. The human mind is a strange and wondrous thing.
