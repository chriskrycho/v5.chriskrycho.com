Robin Sloan just added [an entry]({{link}}) to his companion mini-site about his latest novel, <cite>Moonbound</cite>—[this one]({{link}}) on the independent manga work of Hayao Miyazaki, much in the tech press lately because of his unhappiness with <abbr>AI</abbr> in art; but this entry is not about that, at least not in any direct way. Robin opens:

> What do you say about Hayao Miyazaki, about whom so much has been written, upon whom so much praise has been heaped? There’s your clue, in my first sentence: I want to talk about Hayao Miyazaki, alone, not Studio Ghibli.

And continues:

> … All throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, as Ghibli released <cite>Castle in the Sky</cite>, <cite>My Neighbor Totoro</cite>, and more, he toiled on the manga — when? at what hour?? — steadily expanding its world, pushing it far beyond the bounds of the movie. It is a sci-fi fantasy in the Dying Earth sub-genre, with rich ecological themes, a bright thread of quasi-medieval adventurism, some excellent swords. Yes, <cite>Moonbound</cite> drank from this well.

I was more than primed for this entry, because I have been describing <cite>Moonbound</cite> to people like this:

> Miyazaki cyberpunk infused with a great deal of Tolkien, Lewis, and Le Guin, and seasoned with dashes of Gene Wolfe, Robert Jordan, and Tad Williams.

Go give [Robin’s post]({{link}}). And [<cite>Moonbound</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780374610609), of course!
