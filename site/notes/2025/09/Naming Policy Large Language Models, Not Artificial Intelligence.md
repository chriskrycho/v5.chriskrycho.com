title: "Naming Policy: ‘Large Language Models’, Not ‘Artificial Intelligence’"
subtitle: |
  Because I am pretty well persuaded at this point that “<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>” obscures *far* more than it illuminates.

Just a quick note on nomenclature: going forward, I will not be referring to large language models (<abbr>LLM</abbr>s) as “artificial intelligence” (or “<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>”) going forward. They are indeed artificial, but I think the word “intelligence” implies things about <abbr>LLM</abbr>s that simply are not helpful by and large: it is a *very* weight-bearing metaphor. It comes with a few centuries of history, a history of both implicit and explicit claims about what it is to be *human*. Many of those claims themselves are rather suspect; when we transpose them without remainder to these fascinating machines we have built, we often only confuse ourselves.

Better, I think, to be explicit about the technology in question. “<abbr>LLM</abbr>” works just fine and does *not* carry those misconceptions.

I’m working on a project that among other things is interested in exploring *other* metaphors for these kinds of systems. If and as they suggest themselves to you, I would love to hear from you about them!
