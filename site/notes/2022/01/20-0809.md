Last year, I gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7v-VbFjxk) called “Keep It Local”—about “local reasoning” and how that undergirds many design heuristics: structured programming, <abbr title="object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr>, the actor model, <abbr title="functional programming">FP</abbr>, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and more. (It happened to be at EmberConf, but isn’t about <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>!) I’d love it if you [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7v-VbFjxk) or [read](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/elsewhere/keep-it-local/) it!
