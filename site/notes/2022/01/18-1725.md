I have a rule of thumb for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): any code which requires you to write spread tuple types is WRONG and you should refactor it IMMEDIATELY. (*Ask me how I know this*, he says, wiping his brow as he looks up from slogging through the [Ember](https://emberjs.com) v4 types update.)
