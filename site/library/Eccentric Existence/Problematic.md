David Kelsey, like many contemporary authors, frequently uses the word “problematic.” It appears in the opening sentence of [the quote][quote] I posted earlier tonight, for example. And similarly, just a page before, he writes (of his reason for taking a certain methodological tack):

> This methodological thesis is not grounded in the fact that there are problematic features of efforts to identify the logic of coming to belief. There are also problematic features of efforts, like this anthropological project, to outline the logic of Christian beliefs. The fact that projects addressed to each of these three questions are problematic in different ways is not an a priori reason to set any of them aside. Each such project must be assessed ad hoc as to how persuasively it deals with the problems that are inherent in the effort to address the question it addresses.

When I come to a passage like this, I come away, frankly, *confused*. “Problematic” is doing more work than the ordinary definition of the word here than the basic definition of the word would imply. And that goes for *many* such uses of the word in public discourse these days. The problem (no pun intended) is that it’s never clear to me in Kelsey’s usages (nor, frankly, anyone else’s) what “problematic” actually *means* for the author deploying it.

That’s because—both in Kelsey’s work here and in the way I see it used more generally—the idea of something being “problematic” is assumed rather than defined.
