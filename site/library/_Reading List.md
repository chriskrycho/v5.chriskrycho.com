I keep this page fairly current; it was last updated on {% localeDate page.date, 'MMMM d, yyyy' %}.

- The section for each year includes all the books I read that year (including the current year), in the order I finished the books.
- Books are marked “(new)” if this was the first time I read them, or “(reread)” otherwise.
- I separate out fiction and non-fiction not because I value them differently, but because they just *are* very different.
- Links on the books themselves are affiliate links to Alibris or Bookshop.org!

    No full review for this one, because I’m not going to dignify it with that. It wasn’t worth the time I spent on it. It *could* have been, because the ideas were good, but… it wasn’t. The main character was too much a Mary Sue, a stand-in for young millennials and older Gen Z types who want their video game obsessions to mean something. The very interesting high concept doesn’t get its due as a result, and there’s no interesting characterization to make up for it. Ugh.
