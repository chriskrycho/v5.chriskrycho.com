I keep this page fairly current; it was last updated on {% localeDate page.date, 'MMMM d, yyyy' %}.

- The section for each year includes all the books I read that year (including the current year), in the order I finished the books.
- Books are marked “(new)” if this was the first time I read them, or “(reread)” otherwise.
- I separate out fiction and non-fiction not because I value them differently, but because they just *are* very different.
- Links on the books themselves are affiliate links to Alibris or Bookshop.org!

Quick links:

    No full review for this one, because I’m not going to dignify it with that. It wasn’t worth the time I spent on it. It *could* have been, because the ideas were good, but… it wasn’t. The main character was too much a Mary Sue, a stand-in for young millennials and older Gen Z types who want their video game obsessions to mean something. The very interesting high concept doesn’t get its due as a result, and there’s no interesting characterization to make up for it. Ugh.
