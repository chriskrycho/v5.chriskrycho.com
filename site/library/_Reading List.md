I keep this page fairly current; it was last updated on {% localeDate modified, 'MMMM d, yyyy' %}.

- The section for each year includes all the books I read that year (including the current year), in the order I finished the books.
- Books are marked “(new)” if this was the first time I read them, or “(reread)” otherwise.
- I separate out fiction and non-fiction not because I value them differently, but because they just *are* very different.
- Links on the books themselves are affiliate to Bookshop.org!

    No full review for this one, because I’m not going to dignify it with that. It wasn’t worth the time I spent on it. It *could* have been, because the ideas were good, but… it wasn’t. The main character was too much a Mary Sue, a stand-in for young millennials and older Gen Z types who want their video game obsessions to mean something. The very interesting high concept doesn’t get its due as a result, and there’s no interesting characterization to make up for it. Ugh.

    - [<cite>The Stone Sky</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780316229241)

    These are incredibly grim and fairly violent. I do not regret having read them, but I also cannot *endorse* reading them.


## Tabled

These are books I have started at some point but have (at least for now!) put aside and do not currently plan to finish, but which I might come back to eventually.

- [<cite>Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares</cite>](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf), Stephen Boyd (new)

- [<cite>What Are Christians For?: Life Together at the End of the World</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780830847365), Jake Meador (new)

- [<cite>The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780143127741), Bessel van der Kolk (new)

- [<cite>Essentials of Compilation: An Incremental Approach in Racket</cite>](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047760/essentials-of-compilation/), Jeremy G. Siek (new)

- [<cite>Eccentric Existence: A Theological Anthropology</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780664220525), David H. Kelsey (new)
    - [posts on the book](/topics/eccentric-existence/)

    Tabled, ultimately, because I found I had gotten everything helpful I could from Kelsey’s opening few chapters, and decided it was not worth wading through his absolutely awful prose for the sake of his equally atrocious hermeneutical moves later in the book.

- [<cite>Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780812979688), Nassim Nicholas Taleb (new)

    I suspect there are a few interesting things in this book, but Taleb is perhaps the most insufferable writer of nonfiction I have encountered in the last decade. The core idea of “things which get stronger via challenge” is a mildly interesting idea, but the egotistical delivery and “Isn’t it amazing how no one else ever saw this? Aren’t I so smart? And also isn’t it great how I am ripped? And let me call every other philosophy or approach ‘sissy’ or ‘wussy’…” got very old very quickly.

- [<cite>Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9781260474183)(Third Edition), Al Switzler, Emily Gregory, Ron McMillan, Kerry Patterson, and Joseph Grenny (new)

    Despite a friend’s recommendation, I absolutely could not get into this—at least not in audiobook form. Maybe at some point I will skim it in ebook form? Maybe not.

- [<cite>The Face of Battle</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9780140048971), John Keegan (new)

    I was listening on audiobook and that was *not* the format for this one. Might pick it back up at some point in print.

- [<cite>Open Music Theory</cite>](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/), Mark Gotham, Kyle Gullings, Chelsey Hamm, Bryn Hughes, Brian Jarvis, Megan Lavengood, and John Peterson (new)

    This was useful as a refresher, but I don’t presently have time to work through the whole thing!

- [<cite>Functional Programming in Lean</cite>](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/title.html), David Thrane Christiansen (new)

    This is great, and I worked through about half of it, but then it was time to focus on finding a job, and that meant minimizing outside projects.

- [<cite>Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway</cite>](https://bookshop.org/a/21126/9781574889246), Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully (new)

    I liked the first chapter of it, and I might return to it, but probably in ebook or paper book form, rather than audiobook.
