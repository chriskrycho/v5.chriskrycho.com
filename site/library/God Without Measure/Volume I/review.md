Discovering, and slowly working through, John Websterâ€™s <i>oeuvre</i> remains one of the great joys of the last year. <cite>God and the Works of God</cite> is a lovely collection of papers and essays[^other] on theology properâ€”first of all, meditations on the divine being: in God's own eternal splendor and self-sufficient joy; and secondarily, on Godâ€™s overflowing and gracious works: of creation, redemption, and restoration.

Iâ€™ve read enough Webster at this point to know his recurring motifs, but I havenâ€™t tired of them. They are *very good* motifs! At this point Iâ€™m enjoying seeing (and sometimes differing with!) his changing trajectory over time: in the beginning of his career, he was more Barthian; in the end of his career, much more a Reformed Scholastic, including a lot of _ressourcement_ from the Fathers and Thomas Aquinas. Indeed, there are a few essays in here where he was clearly going through a phase of infatuation with Thomasâ€”dropping references to the <cite>Summa Theologiae</cite> as if it were holy writ.

As academically-oriented and intellectually-dense as these essays are, this is not the kind of book Iâ€™d hand toâ€¦ anyone I know outside the [Mere O][mo] crowd except *maybe* one guy I know at church whoâ€™s a former PCA pastor. ðŸ˜‚ But the essays are beautiful and good, and they were good for my soul. I expect I will return to them regularly in the decades ahead.
