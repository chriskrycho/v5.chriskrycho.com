Over and over again throughout his oeuvre, Webster reminds his readers that God’s will and rule is not the will and rule of a despot who must impose his will upon would otherwise be in some kind of better freedom, but rather: the very ground of all other being and reality, the faithful pursuit of those who are running headlong into ruin and destruction so that they may be saved from their own deluded self-destruction. Thus:

> Further, the divine purpose is not the imposition of an alien will, but that by virtue of which creatures come to have life and to flourish. This is because God's will is inseparable from his goodness and wisdom, and so is the gift of life.

Webster hits this theme consistently, but nearly always just as an aside in some other running argument. (One of the reason I’m deeply sad he passed away and we never got a full systematic theology from him is that we never got to see him trace this out at length!)
