Theology is not liturgy. But it is not disconnected from liturgy, nor need theology always be non-liturgical. For—again, lest we forget, though it is odd that we do—theology concerns God. And to speak of God, even in academic books, even while considering highly technical or abstract matters that require rigor and concentration, is to speak not of a hypothesis or an inert object but of the transcendent Living One, the Holy Trinity who was and is and is to come. And our words ought to be fitting to that _res_, that subject matter, even when they are at the extreme end of second- or third-order philosophical abstraction.
