> Dogmatic portrayal of the canon, I suggest, involves a good deal more than offering an ecclesial gloss to a sociology of texts and their uses. It involves an account of the communicative character of the saving economy of the triune God; it involves an account of the sanctification of texts in the complex processes of their history; it involves careful theological specification of the church's act of canonization; and it involves an account of the work of God in shaping the reader of the canon.
