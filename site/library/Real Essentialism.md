        summary: >
            The world could use, I think, good defense of Aristotelian essentialism. Unfortunately, <cite>Real Essentialism</cite> is not that defense; it is instead a mix of circular and motivated reasoning and arrogant assertion in place of argument.

I read David Oderberg’s <cite>Real Essentialism</cite> on the strong recommendation of a friend: he described it glowingly as the best defense he knew of Aristotelian metaphysics, and furthermore asserted that he does not think we can make sense of Nicene Christianity without Aristotelian metaphysics. Those are strong claims! If I regularly disagree with this friend, I also respect him a great deal. Unfortunately, I am not sure we read the same book.

Oderberg is not a particularly clear writer; worse, though, he is in this book rude and arrogant. At every point, he simply asserts essentialism; he never actually defends it. He mistakes mere claims for argument. He belittles and dismisses the views of others, rather than engaging them seriously. I can only recall one or two instances in the whole length of this book where he acknowledged that interlocks from other traditions might have any points at all! But of course, if essentialism more so obvious as all that, it would not need such a defense. Perhaps essentialism is correct, but its tattered reputation after centuries of critique would suggest that it is not *obviously* correct. A point he seems not to have understood.

What is more, I have rarely encountered a book so full of question begging and *non sequiturs*; it reeked throughout of motivated reasoning. Over and over again, Oderberg simply defines his opponents’ position out of existence, and then declares victory. Nor does he take the time to define his terms clearly, largely taking them for granted! What exactly does Oderberg understand “form” and “substance” and “essence” to be? A reader would be forgiven for failing to know, even after wading through the chunks of the book where Oderberg notionally articulates his views of them. The best I can say is that he leans rather heavily on the assumption that the reader already knows fully the history of argument in the space (not entirely unfair for a book of this sort) and thus only distinguishes his position from others. Given that metaphysics is in many ways just down to questions of definitions, though, this rang more than a little bit false.

It was hard not to come away from this (as I joked to a different friend a few months ago) that the whole book is one long exercise in attempting to justify a Thomistic metaphysics of the Eucharist. I was not, suffice it to say, persuaded.

I stuck it out to the end because I was interested to see how he pulled the pieces together, particularly in his applications to evolutionary biology and the nature of the human person, but it was an exceedingly unpleasant trek. I cannot, unfortunately, even recommend this as an exempla of the position it defends. I would like, someday, to read a robust defense of Aristotelian essentialism. This book, though,  was not it.
