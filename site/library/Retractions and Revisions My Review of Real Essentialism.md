    I still dislike the book, but I’m not well-studied-enough to review it meaningfully, and I can do better as a reader and reviewer!

A few months ago, I published [a rather harsh review][review] of David S. Oderberg’s <cite>Real Essentialism</cite>. On my reading, the book seemed tendentious, rude, and full of motivated reasoning. The same friend who suggested the book to me recently described my review as “ill-tempered and misguided”, which prompted me to revisit it.

I cannot say the book made a different impression on me than it did; but I can say two things:

1. I am not well-studied enough in the field to review a book like this in a meaningful way. I spent a bit of time this morning looking at other reviews of the book, and other folks who *do* know the field well (Ed Feser, for example, no slouch in academic philosophy) recommend the book highly.
	
2. Better to say that *I dislike* Oderberg’s style of writing and argumentation—which I do, very much—than that it is *not an argument*. This is, I think, a blind spot for me, because I have had the same kind of allergic reaction to other books in the past. To be a good reader of books is to read them on their own terms, even if I don't much like those terms!

Between the two of these, I don’t think I *should* have published that review—but as a matter of principle, I am leaving it up for posterity, but adding a retraction note that points to this post.

Going forward, I will aim to be more precise and careful in judging what it is I dislike about a writer’s argumentation, and simply to acknowledge more honestly (including with myself!) the limits of my knowledge and what I can and cannot reasonably review.
