  Donella Meadows on quality: “Pretending that something doesn’t exist if it’s hard to quantify leads to faulty models… the system trap that comes from setting goals around what is easily measured, rather than around what is important. So don’t fall into that trap.…”

A word to everyone—but given my background: especially to software developers, especially to those of us in organizations which pride themselves on being “data-driven”. Let the one who has ears to hear, hear:

> Pretending that something doesn’t exist if it’s hard to quantify leads to faulty models. You’ve already seen the system trap that comes from setting goals around what is easily measured, rather than around what is important. So don’t fall into that trap. Human beings have been endowed not only with the ability to count, but also with the ability to assess quality. Be a quality detector. Be a walking, noisy Geiger counter that registers the presence or absence of quality.

> If something is ugly, say so. If it is tacky, inappropriate, out of proportion, unsustainable, morally degrading, ecologically impoverishing, or humanly demeaning, don’t let it pass. Don’t be stopped by the "if you can’t define it and measure it, I don’t have to pay attention to it" ploy. No one can define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love. No one can define or measure any value. But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren’t designed to produce them, if we don’t speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, they will cease to exist.
