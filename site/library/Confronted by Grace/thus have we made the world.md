> Jesus’ passion shows us up for what we are. It’s the hour of the world’s judgment, because it is the hour when God lets the world have its own way. Here God lets the world be what it wants to be. God's judgment is, in part, God simply letting the world go, allowing the world to pull down the house on itself. God's wrath, spoken of with such zeal and torment in the psalms, is terrible precisely because God holds back his mercy, and doesn’t restrain our zeal to wreck the world. Thus, the passion story tells us, have we made the world.
