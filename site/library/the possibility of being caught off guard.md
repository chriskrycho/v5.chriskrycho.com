> In the age of selfies and social media, one of the most common ways that we pursue personal honor or relevance is by projecting a persona that appeals to our particular community. In itself, this “image crafting” is not new, but the digital age facilitates it in a way that previous eras didn’t. When communities are primarily comprised of people who share physical space with each other, it is hard to control what people see of us. We can try to maintain a certain image—the plastered smile, the well-regulated children, the forced familiarities and compliments—but the possibility of being caught off guard is very real.
