> Isaiah repeatedly puts together the ideas of God as the Holy One and God as Redeemer and Saviour (Isa. 41.14; 43.3; 48.17; 49.7): ‘your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel’. God’s holiness is precisely that which is made known in his mercy, in his coming to the aid of his people, in his taking up their cause, in his bearing their sin, in his purifying of them and in his binding them to his own life.
