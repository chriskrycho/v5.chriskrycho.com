Sometimes I read academic papers—in theology, in computer science, in ethics, in philosophy, in random fields which happen to catch my eye. When I do that, *and* feel like it’s worth my time to spend some extra time engaging with a paper deeply rather than skimming through its surface, I may write it up here!

Hopefully this will be profitable to other learners as well.
