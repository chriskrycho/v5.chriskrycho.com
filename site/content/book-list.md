I've just posted my in-progress [2017 Book List][book list]. I'll update it with books as I finish them, and I'll also update it with reviews (even of the "here's a brief comment" variety) as I do them. This is something I've been thinking about doing for my own sake for a while, and bumping into [this post by Tim Brown](http://tbrown.org/notes/2017/06/23/reading-and-sharing/) reminded me how much I want to be sharing what I read with other people.

Sometimes I get myself spun up on thinking that I need to be reviewing books with the best of them. In reality, I really just want to do like Tim says in that post (emphasis his):

> When I am reading and sharing ideas about what I have read, I feel like my best self. _I want more of that feeling._... I’m wondering if acknowledging what I read, along with a substantial visual (a book cover image?) and any highlights or notes, could feel just as good as having a physical book.... Maybe I could list my piles of books here on my website, and link them to blog post entries with highlights/notes.

That's it exactly. So I'm going ahead and doing the work: I'm going to keep that list up to date, and I'm going to try to write and share *something* about every book I read for the rest of the year. It doesn't have to be a lot---just a sentence or two will do in many cases. "I liked it" or "This had a lot of potential but didn't quite measure up to it." Something simple like [what Wynn Netherland does](https://wynnnetherland.com/reviews/to-hell-and-back-europe-1914-1949/), or something long and careful when it makes good sense.

Maybe someday I'll be able to write one of those killer reviews that ends up changing a whole conversation, or maybe I'll just have a bunch of interesting notes I can look back on later and be able to see what I thought about a book when I'm curious a decade later. Either way, I think it'll be a nice win.

So: [book list].
