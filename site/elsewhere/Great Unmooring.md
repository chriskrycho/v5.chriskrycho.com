My double review of Richard Sennett’s <cite>The Corrosion of Character</cite> and Warzel and Petersen’s <cite>Out of Office</cite> is out from behind the paywall over at <cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite> today, so if you’re not a print subscriber ([why aren’t you?](https://ezsubscription.com/mer/subscribe)), [give it a read]({{link}})!

As with anything one writes: I noticed multiple infelicities of wording and phrasing and even a few clunky paragraphs… *after* it went to print. That is simply inevitable, I think. Nonetheless, I am pretty happy with this—I’m proud to be in print, proud specifically to be in print with <cite>Mere Orthodoxy</cite>, and proud of what I said here. I have high hopes this won’t be the last time I’m in print somewhere, and while I have learned (over and over and over and over again) to temper my hopes and expectations for publishing substantive essays… this year it actually happened.
