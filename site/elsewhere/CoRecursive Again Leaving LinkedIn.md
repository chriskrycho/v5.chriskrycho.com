    I was on CoRecursive, talking about my time at LinkedIn—and why I left.

I had a great time talking with Adam Gordon Bell [over on CoRecursive]({{link}}) about my time at LinkedIn—and why I left. Obviously we had to cut tons of details for time, but I think Adam did a great job cutting to the heart of it. What we build, why we build it, and yes, *how* we build it all really matter.
