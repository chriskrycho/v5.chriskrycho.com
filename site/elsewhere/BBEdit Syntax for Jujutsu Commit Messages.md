I just shipped [a tiny little bit of software][gh]: a syntax highlighting definition for [Jujutsu][jj] (jj) commit messages for [BBEdit][bb].

[gh]: {{ link }}
[jj]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/
[bb]: https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/

Why? Well: I use BBEdit to write most of my commit messages, and I finally got tired enough of not having `JJ:` treated as comments that I decided to make a syntax definition for it.

(…with Claude Code, exactly and only as an excuse to use it for something extremely cheap for exploratory purposes, since people gush about it. It did the job in the end; it probably took about the same amount of time it would have taken me to do it by hand, and cost me 27¢.)

If you are in the exceedingly small Venn diagram of people out there who use both Jujutsu and BBEdit, lucky you! [Snag it and use it!][gh]
