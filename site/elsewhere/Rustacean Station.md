I recently got to chat with Allen Wyma about:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- my work at LinkedIn and the places we *have* used Rust and the ideas we’ve had about where we might in the future in the web space
- the state of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)
- my past, present, and future with [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com) and podcasting more generally

It was a fun conversation—[give it a listen]({{link}})!
