I was on [The Changelog]({{link}}) to talk semantic versioning, types, Rust, TypeScript, the future of versioning, and more!

Back at the start of May, I spoke on [The Cutting Edge of Versioning][talk] at [LambdaConf][conf]. After the video came out, Rust SemVer nerd/wizard Predrag Gruevski (whom I cited *very* approvingly in the talk!) watched it and then we got on a call to talk our shared passion (geeky in the extreme, in the best way!) for versioning and how it can help software developers.

Coming out of the call, we thought: it would be great to get some of these ideas out to an even broader audience, so we reached out to the good folks behind the Changelog podcast, and were excited when our schedules all—astonishingly!—aligned on Friday to record. And here it is! This includes some great stuff from Predrag, and it also includes some things that got cut from my talk for time (yes, even with a 50-minute slot, there is a *lot* I could not cover!).

If you’d like to have either or both of us on, we’d be delighted to come talk further—especially to keep covering more and different territory, because there is a *lot* to say on the subject!

Likewise, if you’re interested in helping us build up the ecosystem around using version to help improve software, email us or find us on social media!
