In [Ember 4.5](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-5-released), we released a really important and long-awaited feature: the ability to use normal JavaScript functions as helpers. This unlocks a bunch of really neat capabilities Ember users have long wanted, is just generally nicer and easier to use, and fits especially well with the `<template>` tag feature coming soon. We will eventually rewrite the tutorial and guides entirely to *just* use this approach, but in the meantime I wanted to make sure we had good coverage of it somewhere else, too, and so: [this blog post]({{link}}).
