This evening, I merged Ember.js [<abbr title="request for comments">RFC</abbr> #0730: Semantic Versioning for TypeScript Types][rfc], after adding a paragraph of text which directs readers of the <abbr>RFC</abbr> to the live version of the spec at [semver-ts.org][site] which we’ll continue iterating on over time with other members of the greater TypeScript community. If that sounds like you, [give it a read][site] and give us feedback so we can make this better for *all* <abbr title="TypeScript">TS</abbr> users!
