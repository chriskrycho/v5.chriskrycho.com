Last year, I spent some time [writing a fanfare][fanfare-here] in honor of the launch of [SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Demo-2 flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2): the first launch of American astronauts in an American rocket from American soil since the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011.

Over the course of the rest of 2020 and the first half of 2021, I iterated on the score for and a recording of the fanfare—and [published it to every music service imaginable]({{link}})!

As I suggested I might in [the final post][last] in my [series][fanfare-here] on composing the piece, I knew that the basic output from [Dorico] and its [<abbr title="Halion Symphonic Orchestra">HSO</abbr>][hso] virtual instruments set was not really good enough to publish. Accordingly, I spent a good chunk of my time learning how to use [Logic Pro][logic] reasonably well, and a non-zero amount of money on [really fantastic virtual instruments][bbcso] to use with it.

The result is something I am *content* with. I am, of course, painfully aware of every. single. thing. wrong with that recording, and I have a list of things I would (will!) do differently for similar works in the future. But: it is good *enough* to put out into the world, and to allow others to enjoy. I am, all those qualifications notwithstanding, pretty proud of this!

So: [give it a listen on your music service of choice!]({{link}}) Also [Bandcamp](https://chriskrycho.bandcamp.com/track/fanfare-for-a-new-era-of-american-spaceflight)!
