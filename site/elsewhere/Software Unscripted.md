<cite>Software Unscripted</cite> is one of the two software podcasts remaining in my regular listening rotation, because it is one of the few that I have found which digs deeply into a wide variety of interesting subjects with interesting people. Accordingly, I was delighted and grateful for the opportunity to be on the show—Richard is a great host and we had [a really fun and wide-ranging conversation]({{link}}). I hope you will give it a listen!
