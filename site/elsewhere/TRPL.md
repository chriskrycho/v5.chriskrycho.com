Rust 1.85 came out yesterday, and with it the 2024 Edition of Rust.[^late] There are a ton of great features and changes that make the 2024 Edition release a really big deal, including async closures, a bucket of improvements to how `unsafe` is handled, improvements to the autoformatter, and more. You should go read [the release blog post][blog] for more details; as great as they are, they’re not what I’m here to write about tonight.

No, I’m here, somewhat more self-interestedly, to write about the fact that if you open [the home page for <cite>The Rust Programming Language</cite> book][book], you’ll see this text:

> by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, <mark>and Chris Krycho</mark>, with contributions from the Rust Community

I remain delighted and somewhat astonished to find this a reality. Thanks to Carol Nichols for trusting me to pick up and do the work for [the new chapter I wrote][chapter] on async Rust, and indeed for the whole update for the 2024 Edition. It is a huge privilege, and I am honored to have my name up there beside Steve and Carol’s names. Had you told me when I started learning Rust and then decided to make <cite>New Rustacean</cite> nearly a decade ago, that someday my name would be on the cover of the official book, I would have been amazed.

I have done a lot of good work in my career, but this definitely goes on the list of things I am proudest of to date.

The good folks at [NoStarch Press][nostarch] will have a revised print version of the book will be out as <cite>The Rust Programming Language, 3rd Edition</cite> later this year. (I have to get them the final revisions for it, hopefully next week!)

I hope and trust this update to the book will serve the steadily growing Rust ecosystem well!

[^late]: Yes, it's late. We all know! It was originally intended to be out late last year, but better to have it come out a few weeks late than to burn people out right before the holidays!
