On Thursday, I was chatting with my colleagues Dave Combs and Richard Conrad at LinkedIn talk about why [Ember CLI][cli] needs [ember-auto-import][eai] today, a bit of the history of web bundling, and how it looks today with [webpack], [ESBuild], etc. (and also Ember's landing-soon Embroider build pipeline, which uses the standard web tech).

We decided to record the session so itâ€™d be useful to other folks working in and around web bundling, especially but not only with Ember! [Give it a watch!]({{link}})

[eai]: https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import
[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org
[ESBuild]: https://esbuild.github.io
