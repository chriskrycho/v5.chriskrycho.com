I’m [over at the Ember.js blog today][post], describing our public preview period for Ember’s official TypeScript types support. I spent a couple weeks this quarter at LinkedIn getting this ready to launch (see some reflections on that [here][os]), and we will be doing a lot more work to get this to stable. I’m really proud of this, and the blog post will hopefully be illuminating for Ember users. (For *non*-Ember folks interested in what we’re doing, you might find [the <abbr title="pull request">PR</abbr>] which landed this interesting!)
