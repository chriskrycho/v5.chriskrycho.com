I have shared a couple links now to various iterations on the <cite>Sanctus</cite> I wrote for the season of Epiphany, but this is by far my favorite: We recorded our little church choir and congregation singing it back in January! You can hear it, and download the recording and all the music, over at [the dedicated page for the work on my music website]({{link}}).

Exactly zero professionals were involved in making this recording, but/and I’m nonetheless delighted by it. It has been a great joy to hear our congregation come to sing it gustily throughout Epiphany!

Hop on over there and [listen]({{link}})!

As a little meta note: that dedicated site will, going forward, increasingly be the home for all the deep-dive-details kinds of posts on music. (No feeds there yet, but there *will* be, and [my music newsletter][newsletter] will have the updates as they happen of course.) I will always link from here when I publish a new work, but the actual material will live there. Happy to be able to do that, even while the site needs a *ton* of work still.
