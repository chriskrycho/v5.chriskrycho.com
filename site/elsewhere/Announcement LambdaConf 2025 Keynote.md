    My first-ever keynote! I am speaking at LambdaConf 2025, in May 2025, about open source software as a public good—indeed, as infrastructure.

---

My first-ever keynote! At [LambdaConf 2025][lc], I’ll be [speaking][speaker] on how critical open source software has become to software projects in general. Because OSS is a public good—because maintainers’ time is a “commons”—, it is essential that we treat OSS as what it is: infrastructure.  But how do we do that without losing the other goods of OSS?!? Come to my talk!

The abstract in full:

> Over the past decades, open source software has evolved from a novelty—frightening to some, dazzling with promise for others—to the bedrock of nearly all software development. (Consider: Thirty years ago, almost no major programming language was free or open source. Now it is all-but-unthinkable to launch a new language which is closed source, still less to charge for a compiler license.) It is tempting to construe open source projects as commons: cultural and natural resources we all inherit. But they are not. They are infrastructure. It is time we started treating them accordingly. The future of open source software—indeed, the future of software—depends on it.

LambdaConf is always a thoroughly interesting conference, and I am honored to have been invited to deliver a keynote!
