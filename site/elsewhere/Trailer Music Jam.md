I set up with a <abbr title="musical instrument digital interface">MIDI</abbr> keyboard and my laptop at a coffee shop all afternoon, riffed until I found something vaguely interesting, and then saw how far I could get.

Is this “good music”? No. Was it *fun*? **Heck yes!** Did I write something fun in *one afternoon*? ***Also heck yes!***
