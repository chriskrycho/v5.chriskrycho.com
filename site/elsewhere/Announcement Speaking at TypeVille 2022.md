  On the subject of “Types as Tools for Thought”—a meditation on: domain-driven design and the power of metaphors, “explicit is better than implicit” and “reasoning footprints”, Peter Naur’s classic essay “Programming as Theory-Building”, and the power and limits of types as tools for thinking and communicating about software.

In April I will be speaking at [TypeVille](https://www.typeville.io) on the theme of “Types as Tools for Thought”:

> A meditation on: domain-driven design and the power of metaphors, “explicit is better than implicit” and “reasoning footprints”, Peter Naur’s classic essay “Programming as Theory-Building”, and the power and limits of types as tools for thinking and communicating about software.

I’m really excited about this talk: as with [last year’s EmberConf talk](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/elsewhere/keep-it-local/), it is the distillation of several years of thought about how software development works, and how types do and don’t help with the specific challenges we face in building and maintaining software over time. I will of course share a link to the talk here once I give it and becomes available.
