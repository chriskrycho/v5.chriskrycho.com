  I am speaking at EmberConf about TypeScript, and TypeVille was (correctly!) canceled.

Plain and simple, just two updates for folks following along at home:

1. In April, I’m [speaking (remotely) at EmberConf](https://2022.emberconf.com/schedule/the-road-to-typescript) about Ember’s road to TypeScript—with an eye to a lot of TypeScript things which are *not* specific to EmberJS!

2. I will *not* be speaking at TypeVille in Poland in April: the conference was canceled, as it should have been.
