Status: draft

	Come and rest! Come and heal! Ev'ry traitor
	  Ev'ry wretch and stinking fiend: lay down your arms
	Find comfort here, and respite, rest, rapport
	  All are welcome here, not one refused, none barred

	She wearied, wounded, sorrowed, battle-sore
	  Bids her children yet another weary soul embrace
	Offer care and proffer aid, render service to her foes
	  As though her progeny were once as they

	Her march to war is ever triumph by defeat
	  Her shields and banners 'blazoned not with martial sign
	Not lion proud nor weapons bright; instead a bleeding sheep
	  The lamb which piercèd, bruised and bloodied, died

	No stranger, prouder heraldry to march beneath
	  But under it she conquers all, so waves she bold
	The lamb rampant! Dancing proud on trampled death
	  On mort laid low by low-laid, somehow mortal God

	Come and rest! she calls--- Come and heal! Ev'ry traitor
	  Ev'ry wretch and stinking fiend: lay down your arms
	Find comfort here, and respite, rest, rapport
	  All are welcome here, not one refused, none barred
	  Beneath the dancing banner: the piercèd, rampant lamb.
