* My wife and I just celebrated our tenth anniversary by taking a nice long trip to Jamaica, just the two of us. It was delightful!
* I recently wrapped up my long-running [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com) podcast project, and have just *started* working on an even more ambitious project: to build a genuinely great research writing environment—working title <b><i>re</i>write</b>. There’s a [mailing list for updates][rewrite].
* I started as a staff software engineer at [LinkedIn] early this year, working on front-end infrastructure.
* I dealt with some nasty burnout in the latter half of 2018. I [blogged about it][burnout] quite a bit. I expect to *keep* blogging about it as appropriate, but at a lower volume.

## Podcasts

There’s a lot going on here, and it’s always changing. See the [the dedicated page](/podcasts.html)!

## Speaking

* I gave [an updated version](https://emberconf.com/speakers.html#chris-krycho) of the 3-hour workshop on using TypeScript in Ember.js applications that I gave [last year](https://2018.emberconf.com/speakers.html#chris-krycho).
* I gave a lightning talk on <abbr>CSS</abbr> Modules at the Denver Ember meetup in late 2018.
* I gave a talk on Rust and WebAssembly at the Denver/Boulder Rust meetup in May 2018.
* I gave a talk on Ember.js and TypeScript at EmberATX in April 2018; you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzxbBrvytU).
* I gave a talk titled "Becoming a Contributor" at Rust Belt Rust 2017, October 26–27. The video is [up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abu2BNixXak), and you can also see the slides for the talk [here](/talks/rust-belt-rust/) or read the prepared script [here](/2017/becoming-a-contributor.html).

## Projects

* I am in the early phases of building [***re*write**][rewrite] (the working title): an incredibly ambitious vision for a genuinely great research writing environment.

* Since early 2017, I've been working on making the experience of writing TypeScript and Ember.js together awesome. [typed-ember](https://github.com/typed-ember) on GitHub is where all the action is at. I've also been writing a series of blog posts, ["Typing Your Ember"](http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/), to help people get off the ground.

* I published [True Myth](https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth), a library for safer (functional) programming in TypeScript, Flow, or plain-old JavaScript. You can read about the project [in its docs](https://true-myth.js.org) or in my introductory [blog post](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/announcing-true-myth-10.html).
